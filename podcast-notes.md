Shitty marketing and non-detailed explanation of product.

Vendor makes promise of easy process, and never fullfills. 

silver bullet and easy button bullshit.

lazy security people.

companies led by marketing department, companies driven by "pay for award" shit (magic quandrum, etc.), we want to listen to technical folks.

vendors are not hold accountable.

CISO's most of the time don't have security background. the sales pitch and marketing is directed towards executives and they gobble this up because they don't know how to verify it and how to chanel/filter it.

CISO don't speak "techinese" and the conversation between vendor and CISO is usually "problem, problem, problem" "solution, solution, solution"

Because of this talk and misplaced expectations by CISO, even the hard-working engineer will try to get the job done the easiest way.

New markets in Infosec was explored this way because of the novelty (Tools managing Threat Intelligence, OSINT)

RSA is Buzzword Bingo

Non-security companies acquire other companies because they see dollars in the cybersecurity space and think they can make money there.

Never acquire products of companies that "AND WE DO CYBER". Always work with companies that their business and business model revolves around cybersecurity.

The fault is from both: the techs should ask "show me, prove me", the sellers should show and sell something appropriate to the problem.

Silver bullet preys on people who don't know any better.

Infosec Vendor: who can maximize, who can exit and who can walk away with a golden paycheck. The mission is money.

CISO/purchaser, the sales and marketing people have a job to do to sell you and market stuff to you, if you fail to see through that, it's your problem, caveat emptor.

At the end of the day we have to make a choice: to go with the solution which shortcomings we've just identified, or sink more time in competitive solutions.

Startups decisions are made based on stocks, seed funding and extreme work hours.

Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.... needs to start with 'let the buyer beware'.

Leadership decisions are more related to looking at bottom line and people, instead of looking at tech.

Straight-up lies: "100% secure", "breach-proof", "you will stop all threats", "next-gen", "quantum", "ai"

Selling a product that does not exist seems too tolerated if it is a 'license' not a sale.

It is a problem that exist in all software license segments. Even video games are impacted by the imperative of marketing before feature complete.

It is really frustrating. Marketing thrives on glittering generalities. It would be nice if customers could fight for and demand clear basic concepts.

how about this for buzz word. Autonomous SOC

Perhaps we should advocate for changing the software development lifecycle to show 'marketing' after each iteration.... to set the expectation?

Vendors: outright lying is outright lying. But if you are falling for it, you deserve it. If you onboard a tool that detracts the security of the company, wastes money and time, and deviates from the mission and direction of the company, that is on you.

Proof of Value instead of Proof of Concept.

Try before you buy.

I don't disagree Evan, but how do you find the time to research all of the products? You're going to fall prey to crap products at some point.

Vendors should take some responsibility for their products...especially SOFTWARE vendors, not just security vendors trying to paper over the flaws.

Software is the only product in the world that you can sell someone something broken and then charge them to fix it. The coverage you're looking for is called technology errors & omissions. It covers financial injury caused to a third party arising out of an error or omission in a technology product

Why SMB customers don't get full attention or no contract at all from vendors: vendors aim to be good enough, not the best in the market, have a couple dozens/hundreds big customers and guarantee satisfaction, and then dedicate with account manager 60% of the resources to them. The next couple of few clients you dedicate account manager 30% of your resources, and then the bottom of the clients (SMB) can go back to the support and VARs, and fuck them. You can't fault it, it is capitalism, business sense. That is what enables the marketing in a major way

Tanium, not long ago would not even sell those product to under 5000 seats.

I don't have time to do 15 different PoCs for vendor products.

Before looking for tools, understand the problem you are trying to solve.

Asking someone's advice is what birthed Gartner. Unfortunately Gartner is all about hush money now...

So, if I'm buying a piece of software, I'd ask my vendor for proof that they carry tech E&O insurance.

Who's got the independent view? That was what Gartner was supposed to be. You want me to put trut in the product, but where is the unbiased view.

The product might be decent but marketing drives the sell away because of the BS.

Why the rush to buy shit? You have time to learn, to read. Slowdown a minute.

Justification for budget is usually very slim, and we get the buy-in from executives based on very thin arguments. Execs need to make it appear they are taking action. Buying does that and gives a place to point a finger.

Vendor: ethics, morals, supportability, "skin in the game" (longevity). Read ToS, read SLA, read contract.

Shitty Ass Program: SAP company joke

Dilbert Speak.

CISO doesn't know what he is doing, get's asked about it, look at below and they don't want towork hard. They look at shiny description of product and onboard it to save their asses.

Machine Learning happens in Haskell, Rust, R, Python, etc.

Artifical Intelligence happens in PowerPoint. They didn't call it AI 10 years ago.

Prohibit security vendors marketing altogether and establish an independent assessment agency for evaluating annually and reporting to the public.

Define list of questions to ask every vendor.

Vendors have to be willing to do a better job, increase quality of transparency. How does your stuff works, how it works, what it does? Also provide clarity for easy conceptual understanding. Educate your customers and you can help them avoid the flak.

Using a PC is not tech-savvy.

The claim is that these are tools, how you use them, is up to you. So the liability is still on the user.

The moment you through cyber into the conversation with C level execs you watch them glaze over. we have to change that.

Software is only required to meet the "reasonable care" standard, it's not feasible to make it perfect, nobody would ever build software any more

It does not fit the insurance business model, so software devs cannot take the risk as part of the license.

Carriers insure workers comp risk every day, and for large companies, the chance of loss is a near certainty.

Education is absolutely key here but reality is, not everyone is willing to learn.

Escrow. Yes. Risk based insurance with low premium or license cost ... no.

"Sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution. "

Why not ask those questions ourselves and NOT from the marketing people, but the engineers of the vendors and post the compiled answers for everyone's consumption?

Product selection and due dilligence is Risk Management.

Ultimately it's about the leadership and the margins the company is tasked to meet.

The best CISO's understand where they are going to spend their dollars and understand how to put risk into context.
You have to feel the weight of making those decisions.

You would get sued for your honesty.

it's up to the consumers to force that change, if we just allow things to continue, that's our problem, we have to push back against the vendors

Yes, to ask the right questions, they need to know enough to understand the basic concepts. The confusion is what is making lots of money from the marketing.

Look for the forums that where people discuss issues with the products and try to qualify the discussions and complaints. Do the issues described applies to you?

Retroactive dividends, if tool does not work as advertised, you get money back.

If you have the clout, confront, ask questions and present alternative. If you don't - ask peer before you tell execs about the product.

Tech magazines used to do that until it was held up in EULAs that you could not test and report.

Testing can never prove the absence of bugs, only their presence. Independent testing is NOT simple unfortunatly for a heap of reasons.

Metrics will lead you in the wrong direction every time. Goodhart's Law, Campbell's Law, Cobra Effect, etc.

Sometimes you vote with your feet to express ethics.

Never trust the Dev/Prod "research" - third-party, even better is user feedback (keep in mind, NOT testimonials from the Dev/Prod)

Colleges do get funding from vendors though. They even pay to use vendor curriculum. That will get pulled if they piss off vendors.

So, without asking for endorsement of the products, which EDR solutions do not suck and deserve to be looked into?

Trust, credibility, Likebility.
