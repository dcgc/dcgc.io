Shitty marketing and non-detailed explanation of product.

Vendor makes promise of easy process, and never fullfills. 

silver bullet and easy button bullshit.

lazy security people.

companies led by marketing department, companies driven by "pay for award" shit (magic quandrum, etc.), we want to listen to technical folks.

vendors are not hold accountable.

CISO's most of the time don't have security background. the sales pitch and marketing is directed towards executives and they gobble this up because they don't know how to verify it and how to chanel/filter it.

CISO don't speak "techinese" and the conversation between vendor and CISO is usually "problem, problem, problem" "solution, solution, solution"

Because of this talk and misplaced expectations by CISO, even the hard-working engineer will try to get the job done the easiest way.

New markets in Infosec was explored this way because of the novelty (Tools managing Threat Intelligence, OSINT)

RSA is Buzzword Bingo

Non-security companies acquire other companies because they see dollars in the cybersecurity space and think they can make money there.

Never acquire products of companies that "AND WE DO CYBER". Always work with companies that their business and business model revolves around cybersecurity.

The fault is from both: the techs should ask "show me, prove me", the sellers should show and sell something appropriate to the problem.

Silver bullet preys on people who don't know any better.

Infosec Vendor: who can maximize, who can exit and who can walk away with a golden paycheck. The mission is money.

CISO/purchaser, the sales and marketing people have a job to do to sell you and market stuff to you, if you fail to see through that, it's your problem, caveat emptor.

At the end of the day we have to make a choice: to go with the solution which shortcomings we've just identified, or sink more time in competitive solutions.

Startups decisions are made based on stocks, seed funding and extreme work hours.

Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.... needs to start with 'let the buyer beware'.

Leadership decisions are more related to looking at bottom line and people, instead of looking at tech.

Straight-up lies: "100% secure", "breach-proof", "you will stop all threats", "next-gen", "quantum", "ai"

Selling a product that does not exist seems too tolerated if it is a 'license' not a sale.

It is a problem that exist in all software license segments. Even video games are impacted by the imperative of marketing before feature complete.

It is really frustrating. Marketing thrives on glittering generalities. It would be nice if customers could fight for and demand clear basic concepts.

how about this for buzz word. Autonomous SOC

Perhaps we should advocate for changing the software development lifecycle to show 'marketing' after each iteration.... to set the expectation?

Vendors: outright lying is outright lying. But if you are falling for it, you deserve it. If you onboard a tool that detracts the security of the company, wastes money and time, and deviates from the mission and direction of the company, that is on you.

Proof of Value instead of Proof of Concept.

Try before you buy.

I don't disagree Evan, but how do you find the time to research all of the products? You're going to fall prey to crap products at some point.

Vendors should take some responsibility for their products...especially SOFTWARE vendors, not just security vendors trying to paper over the flaws.

Software is the only product in the world that you can sell someone something broken and then charge them to fix it. The coverage you're looking for is called technology errors & omissions. It covers financial injury caused to a third party arising out of an error or omission in a technology product

Why SMB customers don't get full attention or no contract at all from vendors: vendors aim to be good enough, not the best in the market, have a couple dozens/hundreds big customers and guarantee satisfaction, and then dedicate with account manager 60% of the resources to them. The next couple of few clients you dedicate account manager 30% of your resources, and then the bottom of the clients (SMB) can go back to the support and VARs, and fuck them. You can't fault it, it is capitalism, business sense. That is what enables the marketing in a major way

Tanium, not long ago would not even sell those product to under 5000 seats.

I don't have time to do 15 different PoCs for vendor products.

Before looking for tools, understand the problem you are trying to solve.

Asking someone's advice is what birthed Gartner. Unfortunately Gartner is all about hush money now...

So, if I'm buying a piece of software, I'd ask my vendor for proof that they carry tech E&O insurance.

Who's got the independent view? That was what Gartner was supposed to be. You want me to put trut in the product, but where is the unbiased view.

The product might be decent but marketing drives the sell away because of the BS.

Why the rush to buy shit? You have time to learn, to read. Slowdown a minute.

Justification for budget is usually very slim, and we get the buy-in from executives based on very thin arguments. Execs need to make it appear they are taking action. Buying does that and gives a place to point a finger.

Vendor: ethics, morals, supportability, "skin in the game" (longevity). Read ToS, read SLA, read contract.

Shitty Ass Program: SAP company joke

Dilbert Speak.

CISO doesn't know what he is doing, get's asked about it, look at below and they don't want towork hard. They look at shiny description of product and onboard it to save their asses.

Machine Learning happens in Haskell, Rust, R, Python, etc.

Artifical Intelligence happens in PowerPoint. They didn't call it AI 10 years ago.

Prohibit security vendors marketing altogether and establish an independent assessment agency for evaluating annually and reporting to the public.

Define list of questions to ask every vendor.

Vendors have to be willing to do a better job, increase quality of transparency. How does your stuff works, how it works, what it does? Also provide clarity for easy conceptual understanding. Educate your customers and you can help them avoid the flak.

Using a PC is not tech-savvy.

The claim is that these are tools, how you use them, is up to you. So the liability is still on the user.

The moment you through cyber into the conversation with C level execs you watch them glaze over. we have to change that.

Software is only required to meet the "reasonable care" standard, it's not feasible to make it perfect, nobody would ever build software any more

It does not fit the insurance business model, so software devs cannot take the risk as part of the license.

Carriers insure workers comp risk every day, and for large companies, the chance of loss is a near certainty.

Education is absolutely key here but reality is, not everyone is willing to learn.

Escrow. Yes. Risk based insurance with low premium or license cost ... no.

"Sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution. "

Why not ask those questions ourselves and NOT from the marketing people, but the engineers of the vendors and post the compiled answers for everyone's consumption?

Product selection and due dilligence is Risk Management.

Ultimately it's about the leadership and the margins the company is tasked to meet.

The best CISO's understand where they are going to spend their dollars and understand how to put risk into context.
You have to feel the weight of making those decisions.

You would get sued for your honesty.

it's up to the consumers to force that change, if we just allow things to continue, that's our problem, we have to push back against the vendors

Yes, to ask the right questions, they need to know enough to understand the basic concepts. The confusion is what is making lots of money from the marketing.

Look for the forums that where people discuss issues with the products and try to qualify the discussions and complaints. Do the issues described applies to you?

Retroactive dividends, if tool does not work as advertised, you get money back.

If you have the clout, confront, ask questions and present alternative. If you don't - ask peer before you tell execs about the product.

Tech magazines used to do that until it was held up in EULAs that you could not test and report.

Testing can never prove the absence of bugs, only their presence. Independent testing is NOT simple unfortunatly for a heap of reasons.

Metrics will lead you in the wrong direction every time. Goodhart's Law, Campbell's Law, Cobra Effect, etc.

Sometimes you vote with your feet to express ethics.

Never trust the Dev/Prod "research" - third-party, even better is user feedback (keep in mind, NOT testimonials from the Dev/Prod)

Colleges do get funding from vendors though. They even pay to use vendor curriculum. That will get pulled if they piss off vendors.

So, without asking for endorsement of the products, which EDR solutions do not suck and deserve to be looked into?

Trust, credibility, Likebility. 

Is it ethical, moral or stress-relief?

Ethics and moral are temporal, spacia and cultural. Add the digital facet, within cyberescurity, where is the line and who sets the line and when it is ok to move the line?

The argument is: it is a grey area. But sometimes dire actions taken get real consequences. Where is that line, has that line been trampoled over, are we right to continue to trampole over that line, do we have a moral/ethical thing, do we take a step back, do we take a step forward, ...?

Ethics: collective agreement (I don't wanna be that guy because we as a group have agreed that's wrong)

Morals: personal judgement/choice of how I hold myself against myself (am I morally right on what I'm doing).

Digital is global (looking into it as an unified set-piece when in different nations, what is wrong in some places is commonplace in others)

Can I wake up and look myself in the mirror and be ok with what I did? (Moral)
Are you sure you should've been doing that shit? (Ethics)

I hate seeing people being taking advantage from. Justice, if you take advantage of something/someone else, I am gonna step in. It is the justice component, I didn't start it, but it is retribution.

You take them down, and you don't let them back up again.

The minute you start holding something against somebody, you're deviating from the way it is supposed to be,

Kant's theory is an example of a deontological moral theory–according to these theories, the rightness or wrongness of actions does not depend on their consequences but on whether they fulfill our dut

There is no amount of money you can give me that will make me a sellout. It's morals for me. I don't know if it's ethics for the herd.

Some of it comes from your upbringing. If YOU think that is a possibility then you are the one that is going to twist on that, 100% morals/ethics can be shaped by your up bringing because you earn from, not just follow. Shape your own technicalities.

If you don't protect like a trade secret, it is not a trade secret.

Does anonymity make us look at our moral/ethics from a different lens, or do we just turn them off?

Judgement: can I trust you, can you get shit done? That is how judgement as far about goes.

You are always shaping your morals if you thought-provoke yourself. Experiences will also play into it. 

Life is a journey - we are all constantly changing as we have more and different experiences

If it is mentionable, it is manageable.

I might lose a lot of friends and followers, but I get to keep my whole soul and integrity.

Turn a light on and the roaches hide, make it bright enough and they sizzle.

Corporate hack-back: you are a business and you crossed a line in warfare and you don't know who you are going after.

Biggest difference between military and civilian on attribution, the "compass" has to be 100% certain on the first. Be careful with false attribution.
Fear of attribution, being held accountable for my actions because I don't have super powers. So If i go down the line, most likely to get caught. I suppose it is different if you have super powers.

“Security as a life skill” is one of the most unique thoughts in our space. Security is NOT just the responsibility of anyone with Security in their title. It's everyone's responsibility!

The HUGE problem is security vs features. One makes money, and the other one costs on the short term. 

There is no buddy/community accountability because it's ME and MINE, and no YOU and YOURS. People today don't feel they can make a difference. In a smaller community, it is clearer your deeds mean something.

We love convenience so we humans are good at justifying things.

Complexity is the enemy of security. "A system is made perfect, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away" Atoine de Saint Expury

It's not so much we don't know how to use it- we don't understand how it can be used against us.

Well, sort of, but there are some predominant ethical theories (duty ethics, utilitarianism, etc) that are the root of almost everyone's (in the west, at least) ethical systems.

For one problem we solve, we create a few more. It is human nature.

The only time we rise above ourselves is when we have a source of authority above ourselves.

How did we have jet packs in the 60s during the Super Bowl, but. It for commercial? Capitalism wins, same with pharma, don’t fix, get people addicted and you keep your revenue stream.

Tactile environment and conditioning are far more impactful to our development (positive and negative) than being "told" or having something explained.

Information has always been biased (going back to Civil War times and beyond)! And that's not good or bad, it's just reality; the best info is drawn from multiple sources across the spectrum.

There is a change in perception that within a digital landscape the threat or risk posture is far less than in a physical realm.

Information Security industry needs to curl up on the floor and die. Literally. It is like a cup of tea with sugar: you put the sugar in, you mix it with the tea and then it is gone. A cup of tea is a cup of tea. No more, no less. Don't add anything to it.

We all don't even speak the same language depending on the vertical.

The current culture is so held to their persona and presence through media and platform.

When approaching and liaising with end-users and IT users outside of our specialty, we need to do it without our jargon, acronyms and geek talk, much like doctors do when they talk to patients (because the medicine field also has medical jargon).

The acronyms seem to be the industry trying to say the same thing that was said years ago. It does more alienating and discouraging than it does getting people interested in the field

Many different products have to come up with a different name for the same thing. Marketing.

It's the "smartest guy in the room" syndrome where language that doesn't sound normal or familiar helps maintain a space and aloofness. Elitism within our community. We also have corporate speak with the bullshit titles and the acronyms for processes that are the same elsewhere with a common sense name, but called differently somewhere else.

German for IT/Infosec terminology: each word will be composite non-abbreviated.

Acronyms come from short-hand and the problem comes from making it an acronym soup.

Do you really want to say "Internet Small Computer Systems Interface" every time in a conversation instead of saying iscuzzy? No, but not everyone will know.

There are conflicting identical anachronisms between IT, Infosec and GRC.

When you present at conferences and there is a Q&A slide, ask the audience or tell them what you heard before, to trigger them to interact and participate. Usually when you ask "is there any questions", no one asks the presenter out of shiness. But also, how do they ask questions when they didn't understand anything that was said? They don't, because they don't want to be exposed for not knowing in the first place. And when you ask questions you paint a target on your back.

We also have to extinguish from this industry the folks that have to feel they can hold their tails higher than the rest. "Coin-checking" with certs is the peacocking equivalent of military wearing their dress uniform and awards rack.

Part of the talent shortage, IMO, is the newbies get intimidated out of the secret club. I have zero issue not being the smartest in the room, yet it's intimidating to feel like the dumbest

Let me play at contrarian for a second: during the board meeting, do you understand 100% of what CFO or CMO reporting on? Do they not use acronyms? Do you know all of those?

I tried to focus so hard on red team, and kept getting told there was no room for it in my market, that I flushed all that knowledge and studied blue team now they want red team. I'm just bitching now.

Part of the problem might be that with the complexity and amazing amount of variables in this industry, how well do ANY 20 IT professionals have a firm understanding of the concept of any topic? And don't want to own up to that. 

Start with their certs and "training" as every governing body wants to be unique and better than the others. 

While you need to be business savvy, is it possible to have a leader with not enough tech savvy.

You learn a LOT more about a topic when you try to teach it.

Eschew Obfuscation.

IoT is a catch-all for unsecured interface.

FUBIJAR - Fucked up but im just a reservist.

AI: Think clippy from Microsoft but slightly smarter. We like to think it’s better, but in reality, in most vendors cases…it isn’t.

It's like a hydra though- cut off one marketers head and two more grow- classic two for one strat.

What about all the bullshit automated emails too. If I want to know I’ll tell you to contact me, not just because I walked pass your booth.

PCI - Personal Credit Information
PCI - Payment Card Industry
Business trumps all. CEOs, CTOs, CFOs... They are not always ready to listen and we have a soup. They need and WE NEED to show the value of dedicated internal teams

My perpetual happiness is usually due to medication. IT Security industry can be very stressful. I feel dirty offering MDR - but love having the conversations with solutions that will actually support the bus as a segue to internsl SOC. Like hand-holding incoming staff.

MDR (Managed) / NDR (Network) = Fancy MSSP

How do you educate the business when it is their business and will do what they want anyway?

Everybody is pointing fingers but who is responsible, really? Who is responsible for the security at the organization? Most organizations don't have a clear delegation of who is ultimately responsible for security. And sometimes is designed that why because they don't want to be the person to take the fall or to make the call (Qualys or Tenable?).

CISO shouldn't be reporting to IT. Fox house / hen house shenanigans. 

Sometimes you see dual-role as CISO and Architect, so as the person in that role can easily hide their shit, because if the architect design is shitty, it is blessed by CISO role with process; if the process is shitty, it is blessed by architectural decisions and historical decisions made in the organization that validates it.

Every time you bury someone in the organization, you are reducing the chances of letting a message get across, you waterdown the message. It is the business responsiblity to make business decisions. Don't bury whatever needs to be said for the good of the business.

CISO lives with every risk decision made. If CEO makes a lot of shitty decisions, you as a CISO are not getting your point across. If you are communicating and shitty decisions are still made, it is shitty management. You go somewhere else.

Enterprise CISO should report to Legal (separation of duties bound by code of ethics). Having access to the legal is important. Conflicting messages from legal and CISO really killing the mood. Lawyers understand risk, maybe not the technical nuance, but the lawyers are most risk-minded. Legal is where rubber hits the road when the business is in trouble. Goes back to being a good consultant. Legal would also make the best ally, if you think about it from a liability standpoint. Even if they're not concerned for security- they will absolutely be concerned with liability. We'd have to educate though that liability is not just a check box. Most often than not, lawyers are your ally/peer in the company in terms of Legal.

SMB CISO reports to highest position that exists.

CEO -> CFO, COO, CIO, CISO (new kid on the block)

A CISO or vCISO can be so much more effective if he/she could have the ears of the CEO for a couple of minutes. Do they just not understand the importance of the risk which is why they won’t take another report? If they took it serious there would be no question... CISO are the red headed step children, children that were seen and not heard. You spend enough time in the board meetings with whole C-suite as CISO and  you could do with less time in these meetings.

Over all- I HAVE seen positive environments and talk to happy CISOs... but more often they're brow beaten. CISO are not lasting long inside their roles. It's like they hire CISO for box check then when they don't actually have a magical wand to wave welp... NEXT- we need new CISO. 

When CEO says he does not time for you because he controls the message and the business, telling the truth does not line up with the business. You can educate the business all you what, but if they don’t have what is “acceptable “ defined, you are still blind. Time to go.

CEO needs to use Social Engineering when liasing with all people in the organization.

I always thought I was just being polite- then I got into infosec and found out I was a social engineer.

Privacy policy does not protect you. It pushes all responsibility from the company to you, how is that acceptable?

Cyber Insurance assessment + legal produce semi-decent high-level recommendations. Risk assessment (external audit) can also help. Going technical from 0 to 60 does not work most of the time. But also, Cyber Insurance can be a rip-off. When coverage for the event goes over 10M, it gives us the opportunity to explain the likelihood of it taking place and the ways to minimize the probability.

How do you convert risk management to business value increase?

The cyber realm is not real for most people even though those same people interact with that realm each day.

Scared to call out vendors and business for going fast and not doing full implementations. New blinking lights = new product and no support for old version. They don't want to give a warning because I bet it will open up opportunities for lawsuits for whatever they warn about. How can we make the companies continue to support all versions.
Check the box, gots to look good for the board. Can’t be truthful and say we need help. Don’t want to look like I don’t know enough.

Is zero trust result just proper active firewall and access management?

Are we more concerned that there is pentest and hacking videos all over there teaching them to break into all this stuff without understanding the device?

People are lazy until they’ve had a reason to be motivated.

Someone has to take the risk of being the first to send the message.

They won’t fix it because they want to sell you a new tool with new promises to keep you distracted.

I layed into the MDR vendor today for not detecting our pentester.

But the vendor can get away with saying it’s not deployed properly. How do we fight that.

The only companies that would be able to survive are those with the large enough legal staff.

All someone needs to do is get a uniform for the local MRI repair vendor, walk into the hospital or imaging lab and have at it.

A couple of classes with organized material of examples of how these "cyber problems" can have catastrophic effects, would be excellent contributions to law and ethics classes.

Why does the ISP tech come in make sure you can get to google and then just leave?

Must have 10 years of experience in a technology that’s only 6 years old!

The unreasonable expectations in the application are just to prepare you to work in the industry.

If I can get someone who won’t burn down the house and won’t make me look silly, I want to talk to them.

It's actually not always the Hiring Managers faults. Sometimes, HR adds additional qualifications beyond what Hiring Managers request.

A HR company just needs to start. They all pull from each other. I see so often orgs asking, what does your job description say.

What is the solution? You have an open position, what do you key off of to forward to an interview. That is what HR does. You are now boss, what do you tell them to do?

People that are looking for positions also don't have confidence in themselves. To know how to sell themselves. Some people that have certs is great however, they also do not know how to map the certs that earned. Or even talk to that cert in the job interview. I do think that certs can demonstrate evidence of ability. Knowledge and skill come with experience.

Certs often do not demonstrate practical knowledge that are immediately applicable in an enterprise environment. They don't teach the logic to assess the situation and act accordingly.

We need more decision makers creating entry level positions. There aren’t enough out there!

People aren’t professional interviewers. There needs to be an additional pathways way in - especially if there is a talent shortage.

Let's up end the education system. Combine the learning with hands on, when you actually DO what is taught, you get a badge. As you earn badges, you create a resume.

Suspend your ego. Be non-judgmental. Validate others. Honor reason. Be Generous.

Give people a “day on the job” and see how they would really respond in the environment. That is better than some subjective interview.

I struggled trying to figure out how to make knowledge management more valued by security orgs... then I figured out that CISO was the ultimate KM role, so yeah...

It's fascinating how Compliance positions desires heavy Accounting backgrounds, then fail during the IT Audits.

There is no one-way into the Infosec industry. It is not one bucket, it is all buckets.

Create a guide that covers the general definitions and qualifications of the technical positions. Then, provide the common tasks and value the roles can provide for the company.

Create a standard for the IT Hiring Process. Market it on a site. Charge subscriptions. Then give back to the community. Need to target the VP level and C-Suite.

Security leaders need to break the roles down into realistic entry level positions.

Point being, we can search within our community for the Leaders who are empathetic to the cause. Then, have them start using the standards that we create for interviewing/hiring. Human Resources will go along with it, because it'll make their jobs easier, once they have a template.

People need to know how to think outside the box and use the transferable skills.

Create a full guide for family, but free version with key points. Yes, charge. Even $5 or $10, can donate to things like Rural Tech Fund (gets tech teaching materials into rural and under-served schools) or nonprofit security cons... YES. Then give back to the community and promote via scholarships, training, etc. Do a Patreon or a donation option, they can accept donations as well. Become a non-profit. No politics. No stance. For the community as a whole. Your amount of effort is directly related to your intrinsic reward.

Hiring guide for HR.

Working group of recruitment for InfoSec.

Or at least a list of "standards" for hiring candidates. Start auditing Human Resources for their hiring practices in I.T.

Aside from the fundamentals, there is arguably no when since technology is constantly changing.

True. There's also a lot of folks who suffer from imposter syndrome seem to have either grown up in abusive situations or ended up in toxic work environments...

A lot of college is just about personal growth. You can get lots of that outside of college for a lot less money. :D

Depends on the degrees and certs in relation to the position. Generally speaking, their values are often exaggerated.

If I don’t have my shit figured out, I have no purpose. If you don’t have your shit figured out, you don’t have purpose either. If my shit and your shit align, we can do good shit together. If they don’t align, we can’t. I’m in this shit, you’re in this shit, and they’re in this shit too. We’re all in this shit together. Some of us are aligned (with our purpose) and some of us aren’t. If and where we’re in alignment, meaning our purposes can serve each other’s purposes, we’re allies. Where there isn’t alignment, we’re adversaries.
Simple. Alignment = Ally. Miss-Alignment = Adversary.
Find your purpose first, then look for common ground in others. Don’t assume, validate. Assuming I know my purpose or your purpose or their purpose without validation leads to aimless bullshit. Lord knows, we have too much aimless bullshit already.

It's a tough call to make. I find that those who struggle early in life are capable of much greater passion, and understand the consequences of their actions.

This goes back to the talk last week... hiring talent. The reasons why hackers are winning is because they don't spend time with certs and degrees. "Can you do this?" "Great, you're hired.".

You do this shit because you want to make a difference, with your knowledge, experience, and help other leapfrog into the industry and not go through the same hurdles as you did.

Time is a precious commodity I can't produce and don't know how much I have. So I want to invest my time in the things I want to do.

I only ask what anyone asks of someone they respect, that the thought of me does not compel you to violent spasms of projectile vomiting.

Complexity is what keeps administrators from understanding IT. Features are what sell,... which builds complexity. Vicious circle.

That's counterproductive. The most famous hacker also means you got caught. And a lot of us helped get him out....and payback wasn't great, hence the frustration. Unfortunately, guys like him are beacons for naive debutantes. Too much romanticism and "wild west" mentality with hacking. It's hard work to do it well.

Exactly. Consulting with Security for new applications is often an afterthought, rather than getting them involved in the beginning. Great point.

Because there's no overall message of safety. Everyone has their own approach about what is the most important piece and act accordingly. I think to come to a common set of terms and ideals, it would take a framework. Sections would be broken down by area of coverage, then common definitions/milestones/purpose/goals/deliverables could be identified. Basically, a similar approach to what PMI uses to identify their 49 processes could be used to apply to the security model. It could be difficult some of it is culturally driven where we learned and how we learned. You create a general set of guidelines that cover most of the areas, that may not be applicable to every scenario, but allow companies to create a foundation for security.

What bothers me is telecoms offering premium services to block robo/scam calls. Once I started paying for sprint premium caller id 99% of the calls stopped. Seems like a scam in itself... profiteering off a service that should come with the cell service in the first place imo.
