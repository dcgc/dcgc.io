# Prelude to DevOps - the Need for Speed

Competition and business innovation is driving the need for speed:
- First to market, short product cycles, fail early - rapid iteration, feedback
- Large Waterfall projects with heavy upfront planning - too slow, expensive
- Formal IT change control to manage risk - even slower, more expensive
Speed is critical for security too:
- Security needs to identify and respond to new attacks and threats quickly
- Slow change means Vulnerability Windows are left open for too long
Agile and Lean development - deliver faster, more often but…
- Smaller teams, smaller projects, more results-focused and iterative
- Fast-moving Agile/Lean teams run into a roadblock at IT Operations
	
In business, success is often about slashing the time it takes from having a brilliant idea and getting it into the hands of customers before a competitor does — or finding out that the brilliant idea wasn’t actually good at all, and coming up with another, better idea or canceling it before the business loses too much money or customers (“fail early“). This drives product and service development to become faster and more responsive, more agile.

Heavyweight Waterfall software development has been giving way to lighter-weight, incremental Agile development approaches for some time now. Agile development methods like Scrum have become extremely popular, as organisations look for ways to speed up delivery of software products and reduce the risk of
software development project failures.

But last-moving Agile teams— and the business Product Owners who are sponsoring their work and driving
their priorities have become frustrated with delays in getting completed software into production and into the hands of users. In many cases, they are creating working software faster than operations can accept it. Operations have become a roadblock to business progress.

The inability of development and operations to turn around changes quickly creates other problems for many organisations when it comes to security. Security vulnerabilities are often left open for too long even though
most security patches are simple to fix and implement. This gives attackers more opportunities to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

IT, which includes security specialists, developers, and operations, has to look at the complete value chain, from when an idea is created or a problem is found, so, when it gets delivered to production. They need to find ways to make learning and change easier, faster and cheaper to try out new ideas and to fix problems, without introducing new bugs or causing outages. This is what DevOps tries to achieve.

# Walls of Confusion

Organisational and cultural barriers exist in most organisations between development and operations — in addition to barriers between the rest of the organisation and the lnfoSec and compliance groups. These are
known as the “Walls of Confusion“. People on opposite sides of the wall have different goals and priorities and competing incentives, use different tools and follow different practices, speak different languages, and often have completely different cultures:

- Development: rapid delivery of features = Agile and Lean methods, small co-located teams, Continuous Integration, sticky notes on a wall

- Operations: firefighting vs. stability and efficiency = ITIL, standardisation of technology, configuration
management, ticketing systems

- Security and Compliance: managing vulnerabilities, evidence of controls = stage gates, point-in-time audits, pen testing, spreadsheets, and checklists
