# Incident Response

OODA Loop: observer, orient, decide, and act. When engaging an enemy, try to ensure that you are not always reacting. Pause, analyze, incorporate information from the battlefield, and then integrate new knowledge into the next course of action. The OODA method works.

FoW: Fog of War. In a crisis, no one knows what is going on and everyone wants to know. The successful IR team and its leader will keep informed and let SME's do their jobs. Control the fog.

Friction: In a tough and tense situation, contention and hostility can occur. Incident response is a team sport. Be patient and calm.

Unity of Command: Ensure there is a solid, realible, and well known decision making process in place. The group should be an odd number to prevent deadlocks. Achieve decision making in a timely manner.
