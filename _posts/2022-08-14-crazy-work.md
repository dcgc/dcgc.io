![CRAZY WORK](https://dcgc.io/crazy-work.png)

“It’s crazy at work.” How often do we hear this? Probably too often. For me, “it’s crazy at work” was my normal. Why is that? At the root is an onslaught of physical and virtual real-time distractions slicing work days into a series of fleeting work moments. Tie that together with a trend of unneeded over-collaboration, plus an unhealthy obsession with growth at any cost, and you’ve got the building blocks for an anxious, crazy mess. It’s no wonder people are working longer and whenever they have a spare moment. People can’t get work done at work anymore. Work takes away from life and life has become work’s leftovers. Long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days, and sometimes, we are contributing to it to a fault (me included). Companies that force their personnel into this deal are molding an ineffective shape at their employees’ expense. You would think with all the hours people are putting in, and all the promises of the latest tech and the best benefits, the load would be diminishing or gwtting lighter. It is not, in fact, it is getting heavier. Many modern companies seem to be great at one thing: wasting. Wasting time, attention, money, energy. Out of the 60, 70, 80 hours a week many are expected to pour into work, how many of those hours are really spent on the work itself? And how many are tossed away in meetings, lost to distraction, and withered away by inefficient business practices? The majority. The answer isn’t more hours, it’s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. Promises keep coming and more time management hacks are done. More ways to communicate. More information spread across separate platforms and disparate places. New demands to pay attention to more and more real-time conversations happening all the time at work. It is meaningless.

It’s constantly crazy at work. Screw that and enough already. It’s time to stop celebrating this way of working. Chaos should not be the natural state at work. Anxiety isn’t a prerequisite for progress. Sitting in meetings all day isn’t required for success. These are all perversions of work — side effects of broken models and worst practices. Step aside, let the suckers jump, and follow a different path of your own. What does matter is your strength to improve the quality of your life, and not to sacrifice everything for the sake of nothing. Let's highlight some of the things we can avoid and some of the things we can follow, and base it on examples of my own experience.

## Company as a Software

When we start working in some places, one of the first things we learn is the company's culture. Usually it surrounds on things like hierarchy structure, how departments are molded, and the flow of actions to be taken. In some organizations, that are usually non-tech and where their main business is not technology, we tend to see that; in other organizations, that are focused on development of software (software-house) or are focused on a product that is technological (software product), we see less of that to some degree. The problem is that companies that are adverse to change will not change their ways when needed, or if they will, it will be due to the outcome of an office politics arm-wrestling between people in management positions (usually middle management, trying to show that they are necessary), so it will be done focusing on the ego of these people and not on the improvement of the company. If we think of a company as a software product, we can think of it in terms of usability and usefulness, as well as focusing on its betterment through tweaking, revising, and iterating. Every software has bugs and bad design, and so does a company. All sorts of new possibilities for improvement emerge and when we realize the way we work is malleable, we can start molding something new, something better.

I was working at several companies that only few people or departments were involved or even remotely interested in the continuous improvement of the business, meaning, the product/service being sold and the betterment of how the company itself worked, either be it directly related with the product/service or with the structure and culture of that company. A lot of the efforts done to change several things, usually doing a presentation to senior management or other departments related with handling the company or the office (such as HR and Office/Site Lead) were shot down very quickly. You can debate if a good and strong case was done at the time and that something more should have been done. From where I stand, a lot of people involved in these efforts did their best and really were interested in change (others read a book and thought they could have a quick win). The problem is that a lot of these corporations have such a rooted culture and a considerable size and hierarchy, that to instill change, it takes an enormous amount of time and energy, especially to propose the ideas from the ground-up. The people receiving the message are usually the least interested because of their faux-busy schedule and because they want to maintain their seat at the table comfy and secure. In my past I tried to suggest change on many fronts, but unfortunately was not heard. From this point on, you can do one of two things: double-down on your ideas with the risk of being put aside (inside the corporation or outside (get let go)) or you can just ignore the problems and move on to the next place.

## Hustling

The hustle is very real and we see it happening everyday, in some places more evident than others (geographically speaking and depending on the company). The idea behind it is that if you grind uncontrollably and if you put your professional goals above everything else in your life, that you will achieve greatness. It goes along the lines of entrepeneurial inspiration quotes and videos. The hustle may have started as a beacon for those with little to outsmart those with a lot (connections and money), but now it’s just synonymous with the endless work routine. For a lot of the people pursuing this path, some end up broken wasted, and burned out with nothing to show for it. These people aren’t more worthy in defeat or victory because they've sacrificed everything. Usually this kind of advice or inspirational tales come from managers and people within a company, trying to pull people into being more time at the office and being much more involved with work (in an unhealthy manner). They are mischevious tricks and they are related with the spoon-fed crap that companies keep giving to newcomers to the organization.

I was in the same position: I worked endlessly in previous jobs, hoping to hit the jackpot promotion or raise, or to say the least, to get a pat in the back (which to this day still hasn't happened). Creativity, progress, and real impact do not yield to brute force and relentless work routine. I did not improve tremendously or hit a gold mine of an idea by working the 14th day (10-hour shift) in a row at SOC. Innovation or progress, usually associated with entrepreneurship, doesn’t have to be this epic tale of cutthroat survival. Most of the time it’s way more boring than that. It's a work-life balance, making the right decisions on how to allocate your time and in what, and ultimately, being in the right place (as I would later find out in my latest job).

## Pacifism

The vernacular usually heard in the companies, especially if you work in Sales, is obsessed with fighting, winning, dominating and destroying. Companies that live in such a bipolar world don’t "earn market share" from a competitor, they "conquer the market". They don’t just serve their customers, they "capture" them. They "target" customers, employ a sales "force", hire "headhunters" to find new talent, pick their "battles", and make a "killing". When you start looking within a company and their teams, and how they operate, it also doesn't deviate far from this. Be it for finacial reasons or for personal accolades, you witness a fierce competition between colleagues, going to the extent of backstabbing and badmouthing, and sometimes even getting the classic example of "pulling the rug under you", etc. It is almost like going to war, where you are pretty much on your own and can only rely on yourself. That paradigm doesn’t make any sense because the workers are supposed to be collaborating with each other to reach a common goal (organizational goal), but because of the corporation ladder, you often see these kinds of movements and behaviours.

At this point, I can't keep up with the number of people and places I have been, where this happens constantly. Lots of companies and co-workers are driven by comparisons in general. It is a matching and surpassing game where a lot of times, dirty tactics (as mentioned before) are used. Who’s getting awards? Who’s getting more money? Who’s getting all the attention? Why are they supporting that guy to go to that conference and not us? Over and over again, we witness this. A lot of us go through this on different occasions, even myself am not excused from this in the past, for example. With time, you tend to see that it does not benefit you to compare and to compete in that way. Comparison is the death of joy, someone said to me once. I don't compare anymore: what others do has no bearing on my capabilities, on what I want to do, or what I choose to do. The only thing we should worry to decimate are outdated and archaic ideas, to help achieve progress each day.

## Goalless

Weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual goals. Small, medium and big goals. Business, team and personal goals. The art of setting goals is something very common in organizations, be it to be bigger and better than the competitors with ambitious (far-fetched) goals, or be it to achieve concrete and real goals as part of daily work. A lot of them are some and mirrors, others are a necessary evil, others are just what is expected as part of the job. Not everyone inside the company as the same goals because each and every person, each and every department, have different interests for themselves, but also, have different duties. Due to this goal-oriented direction that is consistently taken upon, we sometimes see focus being cast on the wrong things that, when identified, are stubbornly denied because... they are part of the goals that if not achieved, will have negative consequences for the corporation, team or individual. Most of the time, setting these goals leads to unrealistic expectations and to trying to reach numbers or metrics that are just not possible due to the current circumstances that the organization, team or individual is going through, leaving the company wanting to achieve more and more without looking at the means.

I have not been a decision-maker or a suit in many of these places I worked at. I have certainly been a technician. The goals (their importance, their impact and their achieveability) will very much depend on where you work, meaning, the culture, type and market of the organization (where it stands and what it needs to do), dictates its next steps and the way forward. In a lot of the organizations I have been, goals that have been set have been nothing but a placeholder because... the organization says we need to set goals (mandatory due to culture). Well, sometimes there are no goals to set based on the job itself, because I am just supposed to work on security incidents, nothing else. The problem is that companies still view goals as being the end-all-be-all when it comes to making some kind of progess, and especially, measuring it. It doesn't necessarilly have to be this way. Goals are fake. Nearly all of them are artificial targets set for the sake of setting targets. These made-up numbers then function as a source of unnecessary stress until they’re either achieved or abandoned. And when that happens, you’re supposed to pick new ones and start stressing again. Nothing ever stops. maybe it is time to stop defining goals.
