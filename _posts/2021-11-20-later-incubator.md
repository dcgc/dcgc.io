I participated in a Vendor Incubator Program back when I started working and was finishing my studies. There were two reasons why I wanted to participate in such: expand my professional horizons (learn more from other people and differently, and if the possibility materializes, work abroad) and start a new personal challenge (take care of things independently and start a new life elsewhere). I think I can safely say that the objectives were fulfilled and met, and that I have learned very much along the path (not necessarily what the Vendor wanted to teach me). Unfortunately, you can't force creatives into a box because if you try, they'll no longer be creative. And no one will want your box. This is what I quickly found out at the end of my run and when I finally moved abroad.

One day, I stumbled upon the Vendor Incubator program, and it piqued my interest given it was related to the academy I was studying at (either the Vendor or the topics). I was studying at the academy like always and was trying to figure out what I could do differently from the others, because I was getting tired of everything around me, and specially, tired of the routine. So, I decided to apply for the program. First, I got a phone call: you prepare a basic script and talk to the lady on the other end and explain to her why you want to participate in the program (selling yourself). Then, you have a quick chat via conference call with some Vendor University Relations lady, or someone else related to the program, outside of the country and get amazed at being able to practice your English with someone foreign, because Portuguese are dazzled by everything that is foreign (really). After the approval from these people, you get to go to the office of the Vendor company and attend a one-day event with several appointments. Of course, from where I come from, everything is in the capital city, and I was living in a not so favorable city (seen as a second-class citizen) and was forced to go there (fortunately they refunded the cost of hotel and trip; how nice of them).

This was the real start of my Incubator path. What followed next showed me that what you think is out of this world and what you see from the outside and from the sidelines, and what you contemplate as magnificent... sometimes it really is not what you make it out to be, sometimes it is mediocre and shallow. 

# The first tasting

Are you excited about technology? Would you like to meet Vendor engineers? Would you like to learn more about Vendor as an Employer? Would you like to learn how Vendor is supporting students' employability? Welcome on board. Vendor Incubator Program is a special educational program designed by the Vendor organization, Vendor Academy, and other bullshit institutions to support employability of Vendor fanboy students and graduates interested in technologies from the Vendor, and of course, starting a career in IT working for the Vendor that you must worship. The Vendor Incubator Program is for students studying a STEM degree (preferably in their last year of studies) or graduates with some Vendor technology interest and some knowledge (it doesn't have to be much, really), who are ready to learn and develop, and see themselves as professionals in the IT industry in the future, and of course, another cog in the wheel. You will benefit from a free Vendor course delivered online (that you can get yourself) as well as experimenting with cutting-edge advanced technologies (because you need to access them yourself), soft skill seminars (the art of bullshitting) and webinars delivered by Vendor experts (another lunch and learn mandatory bullshit sessions that Vendor engineers are forced to deliver) during regular virtual meetings (bridge call) and/or live office visits (at least there is free food). There will also be a chance to upgrade soft skills, customer facing skills and other related skills with persuading people on doing what you want them to do. For those interested in automation and programming, there is the possibility to participate in projects where no person participating wants to do anything and where the person in charge, is uninterested in it because they have better things to do. Python and other Network Automation tools that are in the tip of the tongue of Vendor companies are also reinforced to participants of the program because... well, because it is what is popular. They offer another pointless course and certification for it, which can result in another useless qualification. This program is offered from the beginning of the school year and the application process usually starts in the middle of the school year. Whatever you do at this place – from outdated snake-oil IT products and silver-bullet promises, to monolithic software solutions and slavery consulting - your transformative ideas can propel friction between the masses and fuel disruption in. the mundane workplace environment, so you better behave. Making what's not yet thought of a possible reality – sounds like you? You should move on and look somewhere else.

# So... the (real) first tasting

In truth, the Vendor Incubator Program is useful in several fronts for a graduate from university: first, you get to witness an office environment and the related shenanigans of a bigger company, especially if you started working in a smaller place (which is usually the case in Portugal and I was no exception); second, you get to meet other students from other universities in your country and see the level of teaching from the other institutions first-hand, and compare yourself to others of course (and be amazed by the clear differences in the teaching); third, you get to finally have a small hint on what is “out there” in terms of what you need to learn regarding technology, because in the university and in the academy you study at, you are still looking at outdated programming languages and at products no enterprise contemplates to acquire (both when you start and finish studies). I would add another important point: you get to break out your “chains” and get out of the small-minded city you live in and from the small-minded folks you have to study with (that was the best part for me). I am from Porto, even if it is the second biggest city in my country, it is not the capital city, it is certainly not a cosmopolitan city, it is not the modern city people make it out to be, and for sure, it is still the place circa 90’s/00’s when you have to be careful of wandering around places that will be full of saloios, gunas and bairrolas. A program like this, that forces you to move out of your comfort zone, “learn and adapt” and fight for you spot, is a practice for what is yet to come in the future.

Before I was able to have the official admission, I had to go to a full-day event at the Vendor office and undergo several tests and interviews. I remember the day clearly: I put vacation at work, I went alone on the train, took my laptop and things, and stayed at the hotel. It felt like vacation to me because from where I come from and due to the social status, you don’t get the luxury to have vacations or small trips occasionally. You live to work and you breath to study, because if you don’t do this, you are fucked (and no one will give you a hand, by the way). I had a multiple choice answer test regarding basic networking and system knowledge level (the type of tests that are made for beginners), I had an interview regarding soft-skills (the type of interaction where you are evaluated on a psychological level), I had a questionnaire regarding my background (the type of inquiry that evaluates your social level) and finally a simulation exercise regarding customer interaction and troubleshooting (the type of drill that tests your approach to deal with problems/situations).

For me, it was exciting at the time to go through this: I didn’t really step foot out of my local area (I didn’t even fully know my own country) and I was surrounded by downers (negative thinking), nettys (constant denial) and small-minded people (people who thought life was what was given to them). I am not saying that they were good or bad people _per se_, just saying that they were not my crowd, and certainly looking back at it now (living abroad), not the type of people to stick around with. If there is one thing that is certainly true about living abroad and told by emigrants, is that living abroad really expands your view on your background and home. I was very enthusiastic because I was eager to go to this program. I wanted to get to know the group of people I would meet from abroad and the capital, but also, to understand how daily work is achieved on these types of companies, how do the engineers tackle the technologies inside the Vendor company (what are the struggles and what are the lessons they have learned) and to have an opportunity to enrich my curriculum and get to know more of current technologies that I wouldn’t have the opportunity otherwise (in my academy we dealt with old technology (as it was instructed by the curriculum of the Vendor academy)). The initiative is well-thought: students who want to pursue a career in the same field as the one introduced by study topics in the program, have an opportunity to get an advantage on understanding better the market to which they want to apply and work for but, in addition, they get to understand different types of roles inside a Vendor company, how those roles fit into different departments and how those departments or teams inside them, interact with each other, and understand the “almost” standard way a Vendor company operates.

After that long and tiresome day, I was for sure anxious of the result: am I accepted into the program or am I rejected and stay home? The election and choosing process into these programs is typically based on your current situation at the university and what you show in these interviews. Recruiters in these sessions are looking for people that (blindly) love to work with products from the Vendor (if you study or studied in the academy, even better), but more importantly, they are looking for people who can articulate themselves well on why they decided to apply to such a program. Usually, motives such as “I want to join Vendor company” and “I want to work on XYZ domain” don’t cut it because they are either too broad or too desperate. Who recruiters look for, are students who have done different things regarding the topics of their interest, students that have a specific goal in their minds on what they want to learn and want to do in the future (plans) and students that do not shy away of spending their free time and/or money into pursuing those desires and dreams. If recruiters see people with these characteristics, it tells them that the person is persevering, diligent and willing to listen and learn. These can be good qualities if put into good use but can also be qualities that can be misused if the intentions are not the right ones (as is usually the case). Engineers interviewing, on the other hand, expect people who may not have the full grasp of all the technical topics to which are of his/her interest (the student) but that have good thinking, rationale, critical thinking and that can tear apart a situation and contemplate what are the options to consider following, what are the good and bad options. Of course, regarding how much you know, different engineers have different expectations, and some engineers might be nice about it and have the empathy that students are not on the same level… and some engineers might not be as nice and destroy you in the interview with several questions that require a great deal of effort. Fortunately, the decision weighs on both persons and the head or runner of the program decides on the students that will be admitted.

# The call

I was at the Vendor academy; it was the comfortable and peaceful place at university where I could focus on my work and where I did not have to see anyone I didn’t want. I felt the outcast a lot of times, because I had a different commitment towards the classes, at least comparing myself to others; I was highly motivated due to my personal issues and due to what I wanted to do in life. For me, those classes and the degree at the university were a way to get out of the sentinel I was currently in, to be able to move on and to extend my opportunities and flee. A lot of chips were put on the table, a lot of cards were played, and I was anxiously waiting for the results of the plays. It is said that life changing moments happen when we least expect, be it catastrophic and grievous, or worthwhile and joyful. I got a call from an unknown number from abroad, and I was not expecting that at all. Anyone barely called me. I felt down on the luck (not much in my favor personally), family shitstorm is the same as usual, I was exhausted from work (having to learn and get to speed with how corporate office works) and I was getting frustrated once again with university and the people I was forced to work with (everyone who studied at university knows how the story goes). Looking at the phone screen, either I was being a victim of a spam call or something important was going to happen. I answered and asked in English who it was. After a few minutes talking to the person on the other side, I couldn’t believe it. I was told that I have been accepted into the Vendor program. When I applied and went through the in-person day, I have to say I doubted that I would have been accepted. I am very demanding and rigorous towards myself (and others) and feel that I always have a lot to learn (imposter syndrome), and I understand now years later that in this industry, these feelings are very common. At the time and having no allies to tell me how things were, I had to figure this shit out myself. I really felt that even with me pouring my hearth out that day and fully striving to make the best impression possible, that it was not enough. It felt invigorating and gave me more confidence that I was going in the right direction. 

I mostly kept to myself at the university and in the academy, I learned that it is better to keep low than to talk loudly amongst colleagues you don’t really know, because you face people from all walks of life. Unfortunately, news travel fast, even when you don’t want to. The intentions are mostly good: my instructor and some teachers were happy to have a student to get admitted into the program, given that the program was not even advertised in that university (and with no connection with that university) and having the first student from my city to go to a program like that, given that all students were from the capital and from a particular university. For sure it felt like a badge of honor and showed that I had different aspirations and goals. I hated working on what I was working before I got the job I was currently working at, simultaneously studying at the academy, and I hated what I studied previously (which ironically, nowadays I study more and more, although with a different twist to it (security)) and I hated what I was studying or did not like the structure of university because as we all know, university teaching is old and archaic. Having the possibility to participate in something different from what is normally studied, meaning bachelor’s and master’s degrees with backward and delusional teachers and having no contact with reality (even though the university I studied at handed out the panflets saying otherwise), gave me a feeling that I was about to walk in into something special. The mail that was sent to me afterwards explained all the logistics. I was willing and ready to spend money and time, and use my vacation days to be able to participate in the program. I saw it as an opportunity and I knew I had to seize it.
