Trainee: one that is being trained especially for a job. This is the definition according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. This is what we are told when we are learning, when we are starting our learning experience, our developing journey, when we are weeds and when we want to become tall grass. We feel excitement, exhilaration, enthusiasm, and ultimately, it is what we look forward to, when we reach this stage. I could paste here a lot of quotes from famous people (alive or deceased) like many motivational posters do. That would prove the point I am going try to make, of course, but I don’t think I even need to.

## What is an internship?

The purpose of being a trainee in a company is to be trained and taught a craft or a trade, for a pre-determined period of time. In IT, this usually means a programming language (to become a code monkey), helpdesk service (to become a machine) or an engineer handling a specific technology/system (to become a manual operations worker). The fact of life is that companies need IT infrastructure and people specialized in different areas, to develop/maintain/create it. This is both seen as a cost and investment, also depending on the business and industry the organization is in. It can be a cost due to the fact that we are in the 21st century and the world rolls on technology and telecommunications, so organizations that are not inherently technological, need to adapt to this. It can be an investment due to the fact that the service, product and the business of the organization as a whole, runs on technology or is technology. It is key for organizations to have qualified personnel and we need new people to be qualified and to be ready to work (out with the old, in with the new). 

An internship (or traineeship) is often seen as a first step for a newcomer to start their journey in “cybersecurity” and organizations make enticing propositions for fresh-green graduates (from university) to work on their projects. For graduates, internships are viewed as a necessary requirement in order to gain quality work experience. Many times, employers will hire graduates after they have completed their degree in Computer Science (or not (reconversion programs)). Students are desperate to get a job, which usually means that any company and any job position is their dream company and their dream job. Sometimes, the situation is so dire that graduates accept unpaid positions (are internships really that awful these days?). Despite this paradigm, we still look forward to start our new job.

Depending on expectations, depending on education background, depending on knowledge, depending on life, our opinion and feedback regarding our starting position will transcend our initial impression or will change drastically for the worst. A lot of what we were told in university by professors, who have no industry experience and not are up-to-date with it, is outright misleading. The truth of the matter is, in life you will experience many surprises (usually called “sunshine rays” or “buckets of cold water”, respectively) and the internship is one of them.

## What (actually) is an internship?

I start of by saying that being a trainee used to be a role entirely focused on providing graduates with an opportunity to learn some skills, and also to serve as a talent-feeder for companies. Instead, it has now become a way to source out mundane work for cheap (or for free), but most surprisingly, it has become a place to bootcamp (awfully) normal people, to churn out bad professionals (technically, at least) and to cut out normal paid jobs in favor of internships.  This trend affects everyone. Companies need to get back to the true nature of the internship, because as of this moment, we have an abundance of people who will do a “sufficiently fine” job. Maybe that is fine to not disturb the normalcy (as most companies expect), but that is not fine for efficiency and innovation, which leads to better results and to improvement overall. To be honest, IT really ought to be considered the new “blue collar” job. Internships are the modern version of apprenticeships that “blue collar” unions have been doing for decades.

Then there are the lies: 
  - You will get relevant training (you might get “training” or you might not get any training at all) 
  - They might hire you after the internship (you might be proposed with a shallow opportunity financially or be respectfully declined) 
  - You get to work with an awesome, young, diverse and dynamic team (you might face an immature team or work with a team that is jaded with what they do and want to leave) 
  - It will look great on your resume (because people don’t know what is happening inside or it will look bad, depending on the review in Glassdoor regarding that company)
  - You will make great contacts (a few of them and you will also meet assholes). 

The deal about internships is that they are one of the biggest bullshit *je ne sais quois* things going on, and most of the people involved with it in some form or capacity don't want to admit it. It goes against their own interests. Schools and universities that include it in their programs won't admit it, companies that use them won't admit it, and the students who participate in it won't call out on it because they need it… and so the cycle continues. Due to this, new joiners can end up being a waste of the organization’s time (many employers will tell you that you're great one second, and then dismiss you the next), especially if no adequate resources are allocated: management and recruitment sees them as cheap labour and interns come with unrealistic expectations.

Despite all of this, however, I have to say that even if our experiences in internships were downright awful, they were not a failure and they were an important milestone. When we mature enough to realize that, we truly learn this lesson. There are valuable lessons to be taken away from them and it is a small sample of what you will encounter in the rest of your career: 
  - **From a technical standpoint**, take note of the technological stack of the company, of the many tools used inside, and try by your own to learn everything (training and feedback on the Internet) and understand how it is applied and used (and how it is not) in the company you are interning for, especially if you are being given the same old boring shitty tasks on a daily basis; it may not look like it, but observing from the sidelines at what is implemented incorrectly, will be beneficial for you down the line (learn from others’ mistakes). 
  - **From a relational standpoint**, active communication (asking questions when needed, not all the time), assertiveness (meaning being nice and polite to dickheads), and smiling (meaning showing the personality type the company wants) will help you going through the internship and will prove to make it less painful. This is the type of behavior you need to have when working in IT. 
  - **From a career standpoint**, don’t expect everyone to be on the same level as you and don’t expect everyone to be invested the same way you are, meaning, expect to give a lot and to get little. The more you invest and the more you work, will be beneficial for you in the long-run, but when this work involves helping others, don’t expect a helping hand when it comes time to ask for help (it is human nature, some people will even try to sway you from your path). Don’t get bitter when it occurs, the people who know the most, the people who are more proactive, and the people who work hard, are not necessarily the ones who are the most rewarded; welcome to life, [shit happens](https://pastebin.com/CxwSdWR8). 
  - **From a survival standpoint**, keep tabs on names, projects and companies where you did your internship, and keep contacts that matter: you don’t want to go back to the mud and where you were unhappy, and you DO want to go to where you think you will be happy and work with the people you had good experience with.

## Why you must do a (shitty) internship

A bullshit job is a job which is pointless. A firm believer of the job enjoys and lives it day-by-day, a normal person pretends to enjoy the job and secretly hating it, knowing that it shouldn’t exist. Pretending is the bullshit element, you kind of have to pretend there’s a reason for the job to exist. But secretly, you think if this job didn’t exist, it would not make a difference at all, or that the corporate world would be less cluttered with bullshit. You need to undertake a bullshit internship in the beginning of your career, because:

  - **Witnessing and dealing with people you wouldn’t believe that exist** (really): human beings are awful, in general. Be prepared to deal with the fact that people have different personalities, goals, interests, upbringings and sense of humor (this last one especially). The rules of survival are simple: define your boundaries (self-respect), don’t be an asshole (don’t do to others what you wouldn’t like others doing to you), work on yourself and help others if you want (don’t expect anything in return), and last but not least, karma is a bitch.
  - **Triumphing over adversity** (whatever it is, it helps you to become more tolerable to bullshit): we all go through hell at some point, some more than others, and this will force you to grow courage and strength and see several things more clearly (if you don’t, you are kind of screwed). Tragedy is the catalyst for growth.
  - **Not giving a fuck about failing on something or not knowing something** (it is what it is): the more “fucks” you give, the more worried and stressed you will be. If you don’t give a fuck (which is tremendously hard, no one denies it), you will be free from the shackles of life’s deceitfulness and the after-effects of “carousing”...
  - **Being grateful of what you have** (building character, or some shit like that): getting the short end of the stick will be accepted, meaning you will not always get what you want but you will get enough that you will be appreciative of it. Expectations are usually premediated resentments.
  - **Training to become a jack-of-all-trades and to know how to “MacGyver It”** (basically, how to become a good professional): if you have met, heard, seen or heard a Security Guru, then you have been conned. There are no experts: some professionals have specialties in some areas or are more apposite towards a specific area. Everyone has different levels of knowledge and experience, and improve depending on the role in a company, depending on what they actually do in that role, and on what their interests are. Knowing a bit of everything and being flexible, adapting to different situations, is looked upon as a valuable resource. Don’t become too attached to one specific thing and don’t “MacGruber” it.
  - **Pressure of hierarchy, responsibilities and unfairness** (no rewards, promotion, validation, but a lot of using your work at your expense): depending on company’s culture, depending on the history of the company (what “fossils” are laying around and what relations were previously established), you will face a lot of times what is known as unspoken traditions and unwritten rules; these delineate the unofficial roles and responsibilities of each individual on the organization and on the team you work in, and sometimes, these lead to unfairness. Only certain votes count, only speak when you agree with the manager, don’t be the last to leave the office, the company is undergoing a change (things are out of control), etc.; there are certain behaviors and sayings that will put in less pressure and avoid the unnecessary “spotlight”. This “training” will better prepare you for your career.

## So, what else?

Internship is not the place for starting your career, but the place to start learning about your career. Outside of work, start networking with people that matter (you will notice; it can be in person or online). Don't get discouraged if most people you meet are useless and unworthy: most people are and a few aren't. Practice is everything: the more you do it, the better you will get at it. Start off with people in the same boat as you and then work your way up with more senior people. Be prepared to ask good questions to those you network with. Do your homework in advance (investigate and mindmap; it is not stalking, despite what dumbwits will tell you). Internships can be valuable if taken advantage of: you will learn the positives and the negatives and you will have a taste of what is to come.
