Pee-Wee is the owner of the playhouse and his pals who surround him because they are idiots who need to finish high school so they can go work at the factory or at the local mom n'shop. He is a zany, childlike fellow with a pomaded crew-cut, a hipster moustache (because he can't grow beard any longer), a too-small gray suit to show his shallow professionalism, a ridiculous bow-tie to hide his whiteness, a high, nasal and squeaky voice due to his lack of manhood, and a frenzied manner to compensate for his psychological issues of [jacking off in a porn theater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCj09U1qZ2I) and being addicted to World of Warcraft when he was growing up. His playhouse boasts oddball characters of all sorts (both at school and academy) and talking furniture that he likes to lean or seat on because he wants to be treated like a king. He also likes to ride his bike everywhere ([don't let it get stolen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHxScvu4YpE)) and cook, whipping up such delights as White Ice Cream Soup (he savours it).
