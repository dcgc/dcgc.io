**Cow HR:** Hello, this is HR. How can I help you and who may I be speaking with?

**Horse Employee:** Hello, this is Horse. I want to report a case of my superiors and direct manager not providing me with anything to do at my internship. I have been working here for 7 months and have not been assigned any task or responsibility, nor did my senior colleagues provide me with any guidance or taught me anything. What should I do?

**Cow HR:** Ah, Horse! I am surprise to hear you say that... Sure, of course. Can you tell me what happened?

**Horse Employee:** Certainly. I am currently in a one-year internship subsidized by the government, starting my career in Information Security and was told that my performance and how well I did in this company, would dictate my future here. I am eager to learn, I study on my free time while attending classes at the university. I want to develop myself and give my best, while having a great time here. 

**Cow HR:** Now, now. We enjoy your enthusiasm but calm down. Not everything is about work in life, don't you know? You need to enjoy more your time here. Your colleagues, our parties... Don't you like fun?

**Horse Employee:** But... I enjoy my colleagues, talking to them and going for lunch with them. All the pranks we do all the time or the jokes we make at the expense of each other. It's fun, but what about my work and my position here? What am I doing here as an intern? What is my goal?

**Cow HR:** It doesn't matter Horse. You are here to learn how to slack, collect the money and have a big grin on your face. Enjoy while it lasts.

**Horse Employee:** While it lasts?... I am an intern. I am supposed to be doing something or being taught something specific, no?

**Cow HR:** What about the certification trainings you had? That doesn't count? 

**Horse Employee:** Ah... Yes, I learned from the trainings that I studied on my own time and that have nothing of value related to our use cases at work.... But what about my daily work, my daily duties? What should I be doing? I need to report back to the Government Employment Center and tell them what I did.
