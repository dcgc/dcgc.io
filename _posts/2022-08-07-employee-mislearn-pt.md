**Cow HR:** Hello, this is HR. How can I help you and who may I be speaking with?

**Horse Employee:** Hello, this is Horse. I want to report a case of my superiors and direct manager not providing me with anything to do at my internship. I have been working here for 7 months and have not been assigned any task or responsibility, nor did my senior colleagues provide me with any guidance or taught me anything. What should I do?

**Cow HR:** Ah, Horse! I am surprised to hear you say that... Sure, of course. Can you tell me what happened?

**Horse Employee:** Certainly. I am currently in a one-year internship subsidized by the government, starting my career in Information Security and was told that my performance and how well I did in this company, would dictate my future here. I am eager to learn, I study on my free time while attending classes at the university. I want to develop myself and give my best, while having a great time here. 

**Cow HR:** Now, now. We enjoy your enthusiasm but calm down. Not everything is about work in life, don't you know? You need to enjoy more your time here at the company. Your colleagues, our parties, free coffee and sweets... Don't you like fun and freebies? What about the party we did and where our interns were unprofessional and got drunk? You didn't find it hilarious?

**Horse Employee:** But... I enjoy my colleagues, talking to them about other things other than work and going for lunch with them. All the pranks we do all the time when we should be working, or the jokes we make at the expense of each other's shortcomings. It's fun, but what about my work and my position here? What am I doing here as an intern? What is my goal?

**Cow HR:** It doesn't matter, Horse. You are here to learn how to slack and "exist', collect the money and have a big grin on your face. Enjoy while it lasts.

**Horse Employee:** While it lasts?... I am an intern. I am supposed to be doing something or being taught something specific, no? I thought I was here to learn from others expertise and seniority, to learn on the job and with hands-on work.

**Cow HR:** What about the certification trainings you had? That doesn't count? You didn't like the lackluster training you were provided?

**Horse Employee:** Ah... Yes, I learned from the trainings that I studied on my own time and that have nothing of value related to our use cases at work.... But what about my daily work, my daily duties? What should I be doing? I need to report back to the Government Employment Center and tell them what I did.

**Cow HR:** Don't you worry, we can bullshit them and say you did great job, that you were the poster-horsey. We just need the head count and a lot of interns. You folks are cheap labour.

**Horse Employee:** What?... I don't understand... I have to talk with someone else. I have not worked on a single Single Incident, Simple Change and/or Normal Change under ITIL framework that I had to learn on my own... There ust be someone who understand where I am coming from.

**Cow HR:** Come on, now. I am sure we don't need to reach such extents and conclusions.
