title: Why I rejected an offered Penetration Tester position and why I was rejected of a Penetration Tester position
---

Cybersecurity looks very enticing from the outside, as it is told (very much so). All the buzzwords, all the flash, all the infographics, etc. Usually, this field is fantasized by media outlets, people who do not work in the industry and by popular culture.

When students or people who are interested in Information Security start to get their feet wet and want to move in, belong to it, one of the first things they do is watch some presentation from some popular worldwide conference or listen to some podcast. Usually, it is USA-based. The presenters are either working on research, small consulting firms or big companies, with a rare free position inside it.

For me it was the same: you get wowed by the things they talk, by the jargon and by the flair they seem to have. This happens because you are unaware or ignorant of the subject matter. I started getting this when I was in Networking Academy, all the talk about routing/switching protocols, networking products, even security in the network domain. But once you have hands-on by yourself, once you get going for a few years, and once you start working, you start to see that a lot of it is beautified, and sometimes, to be quite frank, is bullshit.

The main profession, position or role that I got struck by awe was Penetration Tester. There were several things about it: the fantasy of “hacking” as your job, the coolness and swag of most of the speakers (Pentesters), the hands-on, the knowledge. They are seen as Rockstars of some sort, especially due to the leverage (knowledge) they hold and the attention they get (considered as specialists or “experts”).

After 5 years of wandering around the Information Security field, I see that there are professionals… and then, there are professionals. There are Penetration Testers… and then, there are Penetration Testers. I’m not talking about good and bad professionals, I am talking about the level of engagement, the level of interest, and the level of belonging/responsibility in regards to what they do. A good and/or bad professional can be considered as such due to different reasons.

I passed THE Penetration Testing test like many others and attended trainings thinking that Penetration Tester would be a good path, especially after witnessing in action very few other Penetration Testers, on a work environment. But after witnessing OTHER Penetration Testers and understanding what organizations seek for, in their corporate environment… it starts to become quite clear that what these Rockstars were doing is not exactly the norm or another day’s job for most professionals practicing this trade. There are other reasons for this conclusion, so I think it is better to separate them in small paragraphs.

## Corporations: what do they want?

There are places… and then, there are places. A Penetration Tester position in one organization means one thing… and the same position means a totally different thing somewhere else. There are two types of organization (maybe… three) that will look for a “Penetration Tester”:

- You have the typical Consulting company. This type of company is usually opened by a former employee from somewhere else (from a 10k plus employee environment), someone who wants to start a business (Small-Medium Business; SMB) dedicated towards “CyberSecurity” or even focused solely on Penetration Testing. It can also be an already grown multi-million (or not as big in comparison) consulting company that has several years in the market. The main goal of both organizations is clear: have clients/customers, and if the consulting company offers consulting services for other technology domains, extend contract to those. This creates what is called “vendor support group / contract” on large organizations out there. 

	- Some consulting companies have name in the market and can easily obtain a contract with a large organization, even if in reality… the “service” they offer (the professional working with the customer) is subpar. Smaller consulting companies have to scratch the surface and are not able to drilldown into the market, so they have to be satisfied with crumbles from the ground, left by the bigger consulting companies. This leads to two types of smaller consulting companies: the ones who are ambitious (that are active in the Information Security community and have a name online (online presence)) or the ones who are not ambitious (that do not have an understanding of the Information Security market and want to be in the space because… just because; they also like to sell snake oil).

	- Usually, these companies want people who have done the legwork and really want to be Penetration Testers, but due to the shortage of professionals, more people are being admitted or considered for the position… even though they don’t have the credentials (that you can obtain with hard work, fair), but ultimately, that don’t have the profile (they don’t care or want to be bothered how something “works”). Also, with the rise of more companies like these being born (like mushrooms) and the operations (HQ, HR, etc.) being done remotely, after the COVID-19 lockdown/confinement showing that we do not need to be stuck in a physical office or in a particular location in the world, the demand for professionals and the lack of them (of proper ones, rather) will make the quality and level of performance decrease from stellar to mediocre.

	- Because of the presence of all these consulting companies in the market, in this security space, it creates confusion to someone who would want to work as a Penetration Tester: what is the end goal, what is the motivation, for the service you provide? Money, sure. It is a business, but what else? People applying already have to deal with vague and non-descriptive job postings and get pre-constructed answers in the interviews they attend, but how to know for sure what is the _modus operandi_ when it comes to the job, how and what is conducted when working with a costumer? This can be considered disclosure that can be harmful to the consulting company (spilling the beans), but it is what in the end, people who have invested hundreds of hours studying on several topics regarding Penetration Testing, a couple of grands on papers to show you have the skills, want to know. They want to know what they will be doing and if that company is a good fit for them. Unfortunately, in most cases (unless you know someone on the inside or read reviews), you will not be able to know this until you join the squadron and start devoting yourself to the cause.

	- The other bullet point to add to the confusion when applying to these places is the marketing around consulting firms and around Penetration Testing services they offer. Big 5 Consulting Firms and the market saturation of these services comes to my mind. The website (from marketing department), the job description (as mentioned before), the people working (people and their Linkedin profiles tell a different story because even they are confused), as well as with misconception on what a Penetration Tester job should be, create a mess of a message by these companies and in the end, people applying are wondering “what the fuck?”.

	- There is also the fact that companies now are starting to see that the flowered green grass that they are acquiring, is after all not what it seems, and that actually hiring a few dozen of people and setting up the services themselves, leads to a cheaper alternative in the long-run. The rise of internal teams replacing consulting firms’ contract (not to 100% due to audits and other regulatory requirements) leads more job posts like these happening and showing up. Both roles are different as we can imagine, someone working on an Internal team as opposed with someone working as a Consulting Pentester… but they don’t tell that.

	- In the end, there are two situations when going to consulting companies: you either get to go to a good place, where you are given a chance to develop yourself and contribute to the company (open-source projects, present at conference (whatever) on behalf of the company, etc.) and are surrounded by good people (tough but fair; knowledgeable, and willing to share), or you end up in a place where the level of engagement is damn low and where it is in the interest of the company to grow based on the next client they get, instead of focusing on giving back to the Information Security community and growing the name of the company.

	- You will be rejected because: A) you don’t have the desired level of knowledge, as in, you don’t have the level of knowledge as someone experienced and they are not willing to let you develop it (in some rare occasions, they can admit you and let you develop it); B) you don’t have networking, as in, you don’t know the right people (you didn’t talk with X, Y and Z); and C) you were not cheap enough for their wallets.

-	Mid-Big organizations, as mentioned before, are starting to create their own Information Security teams and one of the roles being created is Penetration Tester. But what they actually mean is they want someone who will run a couple of tools, allowing the organization to be able to “tick the box” on the annual or quarterly audit and hand over the papers to the regulatory body. It is nothing more than a pro-form, other than actually creating a security program inside the organization and promoting a shift in culture and mindset.

	- When you are studying for a Penetration Tester position and when you are done getting the required qualifications to apply to a “beginner” level position regarding it, you start looking for a job. You will find several Penetration Tester positions at companies where their core business is not even Cybersecurity and you start wondering and picturing in your head that you will be doing penetration testing against mainframes in financial markets or against aircraft in airlines (usually this drivel is spoken on interviews). Not necessarily…  most of these positions have to do with corporate environment, and at most, you will be testing against web applications or server infrastructure. But the reality is this: you will not be doing Penetration Testing. For several reasons: first, you will not write reports or do reporting as you learn a Penetration Tester does; second, you will not use several of the tools you have used in your studies, you will not follow any pentesting methodologies, you will not for sure work with other teams inside the organization regarding things such as threat modelling, asset inventory, technology stack, etc.; third, teams and people will not be aware you exist. It sounds disheartening, because it is. Organizations are creating positions for this, don’t know the necessary requirements for the job post and don’t know the “business as usual” for something like this. Applicants have expectations and they get crushed when they face a situation like this. 

	- You will find a lot of types of employees in these places: employees who do not give a shit, employees who are not cut out for the job, employees who do the bare minimum, employees who are dedicated but are fed up with all of it and change internally or leave the company, employees who know “how to stay”. If you would be a Penetration Tester in this organization and would like to do a job well done, you would face several challenges thanks to this: people will not listen to you (you are not the “expert” from Consulting Firm / Vendor), you will not be given priority (Information Security is not a priority and/or investment in these places, it is a cost), and you will not be given the proper tools/equipment to perform your job (“budget” reasons, meaning they don’t want to fully invest in it and they don’t want to admit that they don’t know what to “get”)). It sounds disheartening, because it is. Organizations and leadership around these circles don’t have the Security mindset to be developing programs, don’t have the experience, and most of all, don’t have the interest in the “stuff”, to be on the helm of creating a unit for “CyberSecurity” of the company. It shows, really…

	- At the end of it all, what is more difficult to accept is that all the small efforts done in these places towards Penetration Testing and bettering security posture of the company (whatever the hell that means,) will in fact not really be celebrated. They will be seen as a hindrance. You are not part of the business, period. You will also feel as a cog on the wheel, as an ant on the colony. It’s not about ego, it is about making a difference and seeing results. Even if some results are achieved, this is not conveyed by the organization and by the leadership, you will feel left out and you will feel that everything is pointless. To some extent, it is…

	- You will be rejected because: A) you were honest in the interviews B) the company (the hiring manager) opened up the position for someone else in mind C) you don’t know anything about Penetration Testing

	- Another position that is very interesting to people who hear about it and are still trying to get into Penetration Testing is the one of researcher and/or bug bounter. All of this in the end means the same thing (even if the type of work is different), because the workflow is based on the work you put in, the results you get, and the name you create and market for yourself… which means that if you get squat, you are fucked (no money, no survival). Unless you do this type of job (typically the first, researcher) in a corporation, then you will get regular and consistent income… and normally, do jack shit.

	- The great thing about something like research, applicable with research for other fields, is the flexible goals and time you have for it, and this allowing you to think of it as purely technical work, actually self-satisfying and rewarding (you are “pentesting” technology for NEW vulnerabilities, insecurities, etc.) and in the end feeling, you are making some kind of difference. New CVE’s (Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits) you might find might be, in the grand scheme of things, worthless, but at least it proves to yourself that you are “discovering something new”, either with known TTP’s (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) or with new attack vectors. This, depending on how you leverage it, might put you on the map in the Information Security community, and if applying to known conferences, even being able to talk about it to an audience (besides an article on the Internet).

	- Bug Bounty is the cousin of Research: it is a form of Research but with clear and defined goals, methods and rewards (usually stipulated by the companies putting up the Bug Bounties). There are several platforms (some more popular than others) that host a plethora of bounties from different companies, usually surrounding Web Application. The stipulation, memorandum of understanding if you will, is stated on the Bug Bounty platform/website and people have to respect it and follow or act in accordance to the scope demanded by the bounty poster. This leads to easy bounties (low hanging fruit) or very difficult ones. There is a lot of people in these websites so… you can imagine how hard it can be to get a successful bounty: it is about timing and about knowledge, surely. The key takeaway from this is that, for a newbie to solely start working/developing/studying on Penetration Testing in Bug Bounty platforms… is almost an impossible route.


	- Both sound stressful, because they are (at least for a beginner). There is a very high and throat-cutting competition in both fields, and you will find yourself thinking that you will have to cut sleep. The problem with Bug Bounty and Research is that some of it is dominated by veterans: people who have been doing this trade for 10+ or 20+ years... because let’s face it, not much has changed in how technology is built and how testing is done. Research in a company (usually a product vendor) is potentially a bad role because of the scope of Pentesting, the scope of the targets (only products of the vendor or technology it uses around that) and the disclosure (you are on a leash). If you are willing to be a YES man and not have critical thinking, it might sound nice… if you are a normal human being, then not. Bug Bounty is a nice deviation from your main/daily job but not as a full-time gig, if you are starting out of course. There is just too many people doing this and rather qualified, so you will not have the steady financial income from this.

	- You WILL be rejected for a research role because you don’t have the experience (meaning you are a noob). You WILL not be admitted into the Bug Bounty platform or you WILL not get a successful bounty because you don’t have the experience (meaning you are chobo).


## The work: What will I do?

“Pentesting work” will be divided into few “domains” (type of targets) and will be divided by type of interaction (“ways of testing”). Usually, the main “domains” are Web Application (the main one), Mobile Application (the other type of application you might see, not as common) and Server (OS, Middleware (maybe), web services). Cloud and Containers are on the rise, but not as common unfortunately. The “ways of testing” are all about the tools you use: dynamic (“automatic”) testing will normally involve scanning (network-based, application-based) and static (“manual”) testing will involve proxying, creating requests manually and trade-crafting (payloads), interacting with the targets.

The main problem while working with clients or internally has to do with what we are allowed to do, and a lot of times it is difficult to answer because… the people requesting the Penetration Test also don’t know. It starts with the scope: what targets we want to “check”, what vulnerability families we want to focus, what is the goal from this Penetration Test, why are we doing this in the first place? Then it continues with the tools: what tools are allowed, what tools to use, what type of access should we have (type of testing)? Then the doubt continues (or not): should we define and state what should be done and how because the client/stakeholder/internal team doesn’t know, should I give my 2 cents, should I spoon feed them on what they are seeking after? Instead of the pentester focusing on the job technically, the professional ends up wasting time defining things that are not his priority or even responsibility and has to use a lot of his/her time on communication (which is part of the job, no doubt about it, but it is not supposed to be an ironman long activity). Frustration comes into play; shenanigans materialize and then the shitshow commences.

This is what mostly happens in a lot of places where Penetration Testing work is done: nothing substantial technically is done and a lot of time is spent on doing the legwork for the customer (who should be educated when requesting the Penetration Testing service). Do I really want to go for a position that was promised to me to be the ultimate seat for technical development in Information Security, and end up doing Tenable.IO scans and Burp Suite proxying most of the time? Yep…

## Pentester position: Why I was rejected

Before I did qualifications regarding Penetration Test, I tried to apply to the first aforementioned two types of companies: it didn’t end well, but it was fruitful to understand what these places in particular were looking after.

What position and chance does someone who has recreational activities regarding Penetration Testing, no “work experience” in Penetration Testing or in a “Red Team” position (whatever the hell that means) and with no “paper” or given proof in tradecrafting or PoC (Proof of Concept) development? An unfavorable position and a slim chance. Penetration Test is a position for seniority, for someone who has worked in different positions and has seen a bit of everything throughout his/her career, or for someone who is crazy enough to devote a lot of his/her time to the craft… in theory, this is what the position is, but it is possible (due to the opportunities that exist) to get to work as Pentester.

So, what went wrong? First, you need a “paper”, the one where you put your hands on virtual machines, not the one where you practice nmap. This is enough proof that you have very basic skills and understanding when it comes to this type of position, but it is not proof that you understand or have the mentality to be working in such trade. Second, you need to be up-to-date with what is happening (news), meaning vulnerabilities, threats, products and projects. Some organizations and some projects will be given more spotlight than others due to popularity and history, but others might be highlighted depending on where you apply. Third, concepts, technology you learn outside of Security, you need to understand them, in and out, and the applicability of it must be interchangeable between products, deployments and use cases. 

I didn’t have the paper; I didn’t completely follow the news and I didn’t understand all concepts (all use cases). Do most companies recruiting for this position expect this? No, but the good ones will. This is what I faced applying to a consulting company (and having interview), and this is what I didn’t face applying to a big-mid company (not having interview). Why I was rejected to the second one? No paper.

## Pentester position: Why I rejected it

After certifying (the paper), after devoting time to studying Penetration Testing and after understanding the _status quo_ of what the Penetration Testing job market was for a newbie, I started once again applying to these positions and hoping to see what the outcome would look like.

The results were not surprising: I got more interviews. But what was surprising was the interviewing posture of the interviewers on most interviews: because I got the paper, the interview was less demanding, less laborious, less detailed, and less technical. The interviewers thought that because the candidate had a piece of paper, that he was in the “clear” to be able to work for their organization. This is alarmingly serious and a red flag, it shows that some roles are dependent on a piece of paper, on pre-conceived notions of what Penetration Tester qualifications should ideally be, and not on the true technical skills of someone, especially on the answers a candidate gives based on the inquiry. It also shows that some places are not mature to start offering Penetration Testing services and/or to have an internal Penetration Testing team, don’t have the backbone to do so and will not attract the right and correct people to be working on such a thing.

Now, it will depend on the individual: there are people who are ok with this and will accept. Good professionals and people who have passion for the field, will discard such chances, go back to the drawing board and continue with self-development. This is the outlook on what the talk about demand vs offer in “CyberSecurity” is about: you have a lot of positions being built and opened for different types of job inside Information Security, but most of them are goalless and unfocused, created by people with no “security vision” whatsoever. Then you have a lot of people wanting to jump onto the ship, but without any kind of idea where they are going or with a lot of misconceptions on what is actually done. This is why the previously mentioned Penetration Testing positions are created and filled, and this is why the bar is set low. 

## What is the point?

Until higher technical scrutiny and screening isn’t done for Penetration Testing and until there is no understanding what this position is, we will have the situation as it is. I rejected it. It didn’t feel right, because it is not. A lot of it is because of what I detailed… Other things have to do with depositions from people such as s1mon. Penetration Testing work is uninteresting and non-rewarding because the audience you are talking to continue to poorly understand what they have and manage, and over-complicate what is simple. Penetration Tester is continuously seen as a “fixer” and/or a “breaker”, when it should be seen as an “enabler” (enables you to show what can be done differently, security-wise). We already know we are vulnerable (we can run the tools to check this ourselves), we already know what is the answer (configuration workaround, patching, etc.) and we already know what we should’ve done (it’s in the compliance we have to follow). Why is the Penetration Tester a messiah?

Maybe one day, I will have the possibility to enjoy being the Rockstar I dreamed of at someplace like Defcon, but until then, I will stay in my corner working as a “regular security professional”.
