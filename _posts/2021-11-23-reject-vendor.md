So many reputable brands, so many recognizable names, so many legacy households. Long before we start our careers in IT and when we are studying in university, we go to the career fair, and we see all these stands and booths everywhere. We get amazed at the grandiosity of the famous logo; we see it mentioned throughout our studies and the majestic presence of the company intimidates us. It is curious that after a few years of working in IT and working in Security, I look back at my time at the exhibition stands and at my time at the academy while studying, and I see how I feel about Vendors in general nowadays and witness the drastic change of opinion I have had, especially after working for one (in several positions) and after working with several products from different Vendors. It’s smoke and mirrors, no doubt about it, but it is also more than that: the fact that there are different roles within a Vendor company means that each person has a different task and a different goal. Some align more with cheating the customer, but others rely more with supporting the customer to the best of that person’s abilities. I was in the latter spectrum, and I still have nothing but full respect for the people who must work in such a place and position, being that some of them felt miserable about it (still feel). After a long period of working for a Vendor, I worked in a place full of bureaucracy and autocracy and learned that not every company is right for an IT person. I was working as a Security Engineer and left the support world for long. I was going to make a change, and decided to apply for a Vendor for a similar position as I was in. I wanted to know what is to work for a Vendor when you are not supporting or selling their product. What would a person do if not that? I succinctly learned that shaking hands, name-dropping, smiling from ear to ear and patting on the back of others is what guarantees you a position in such places. It was known to me that it was needed for keep your seat and to move up, but it was unknown to me that was needed to have admission to somewhere and somehow. The rest (keep reading) is history.
