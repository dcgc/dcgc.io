So many reputable brands, so many recognizable names, so many legacy households. Long before we start our careers in IT and when we are studying in university, we go to the career fair, and we see all these stands and booths everywhere. We get amazed at the grandiosity of the famous logo; we see it mentioned throughout our studies and the majestic presence of the company intimidates us. It is curious that after a few years of working in IT and working in Security, I look back at my time at the exhibition stands and at my time at the academy while studying, and I see how I feel about Vendors in general nowadays and witness the drastic change of opinion I have had, especially after working for one (in several positions) and after working with several products from different Vendors. It’s smoke and mirrors a lot of the ties, no doubt about it, but it is also more than that: the fact that there are different roles within a Vendor company means that each person has a different task and a different goal. Some align more with cheating the customer, but others rely more with supporting the customer to the best of that person’s abilities. After a long period of working for a Vendor, I came to several conclusions and hope to address them here. Bureaucracy, autocracy but flexibility and adatability: each place is different and not every company is right for a person in the IT industry. I wanted to know what is to work for a Vendor when you are not supporting or selling their product. What would a person do if not that? I succinctly learned some hard truths and what guarantees you a position in such places. It was made known to me what was needed to keep your seat and, in some cases, to move up the ladder or get admission somewhere and somehow. 

# What roles are available

Vendors are focused on delivering products, services and subscriptions. For all of these they need manpower. So, a lot of the people working in these places are a cog on the machine, even if their title doesn’t convey so (some people enjoy that, others don't). Suffice to say, you need that manpower especially if the organization is international and worldwide. The demand from customers and the frenetic pacing of buying/subscribing in different timezones, warrants the organization to pull up their sleeves, get to work and assure that the customer will be on their side, at all costs. They are a business. They need to guarantee that a customer will be with them. Selling the dream, sweetening the deal and making sure the lifeline is still beeping are the day-to-day activities from the Vendor organization. Most roles inside the Vendor organization are related with all of this. 

In the Security spectrum, you have different types of roles: some are associated with the magic show of showing off products, some are related with supporting the charade of products and customers and being the customer's bitch, some are in the basis of building and configuring these based on unfounded templates and "god knows what" design/architectural decisions, and some are more related with Technical Security PR.
