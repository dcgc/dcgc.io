![CRUELLA](https://dcgc.io/cruella.png)

Cruella de Vil, Cruella cruel. She is more treacherous than a rattlesnake. Cruella, Cruella cruel. Through her veins only flows bile. I am sure that Cruella came from a very cruel place. Her eyes are from someone, from someone who comes from the beyond. And that beyond, I know, is not from heaven. She is an eccentric, control-obsessed heiress who wishes to use the “skins” of 99 Security employees to create a spotted security team and a comfy manager position. A “witch”, a “devil woman”, Cruella’s infatuation with managing and dictating over others, drives her to a murderous insanity. She commits immoral acts to satisfy her mania, such as baseless sacking of employees (e.g., screenshot manipulation) and falsehood over everyone (e.g., a bit of "he-said/she-said"). In her mad pursuits, Cruella is typically aided by her henchmen, Horace (the muscle) and Jasper (the brains).

Cruella is not a schemer, nor does she have any powers. Instead, she acts purely on impulse and is thus prone to reckless behavior, particularly when stepping on others so she can get what she wants. Cruella de Ville makes sure that she has her way. In the eyes of everyone in the Security department, she seems invincible, keeping her goons at bay, and unable to face “the devil woman”, the only hope is to flee or hide. She cannot be defeated, even when facing the incompetence of her henchmen. If you face her, you might have misfortunes in your path. 

Cruella is known to be mean and rude, frequently barging into other people's business unannounced and openly disrespecting others. She adores attention but looks down on others, showing no sympathy or concern for anyone's well-being. She is also greedy and selfish and adores attention. Her interest in security revolves around significance, particularly in the form of accolades, rewards and bonus, as she is always looking to prove her existence in the department. As a result, Cruella often exploits others to help her with maintaining her “spot”. Upon learning that someone who joined the team, might know a deal more, Cruella attempted to “buy the person out”, showing no concern for the individual, having already “bought” others in the team. The reason for her obsession is control, power and position inside the department, meaning she'll get more money and influence. Her interest in domination runs so deep she turned to everyone else after seeing this individual, and made sure everyone shared the same “thoughts”.

Cruella is known to be short-tempered. She gets annoyed easily with Jasper and Horace's foolishness and throws a tantrum when things don't go her way. Her anger seems to be a problem, as it makes her reckless and impulsive, as she drove her team and department into a ravine. She may also be bipolar, as she is prone to psychotic fits; her reckless management is a prime example. This happened again and again when she tried to build Security Operations, only to end up being a “drag and drop” kid’s play doodles. However, she did seem to be a slightly reasonable woman in her actions, as she attempted to reasonably parlays with HR, as to dismiss several people, becoming clear that it was the only way for her to maintain her power.

Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil. If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will. To see her is to take a sudden chill. Her menacing pose, the ice in her stare. All innocent employees had better beware. She's like a spider waiting for the kill. At first you think Cruella is the devil, but after time has worn away the surprise, you come to realize, you've seen her kind of eyes, watching you from very far (from her pedestal). Watch out, don’t gamble your future.

Don't be like Cruella de Vil:

- ["Bitches get stitches"](https://pastebin.com/hyxtUu1K) but ["snitches get stitches"](https://pastebin.com/Wk2wzpFv), so it works both ways.

- Stay relevant in your position (manager) by your contribution: your usefulness dictates your success, not your name or who you are.

- Security planning, operations and engineering is a teamwork: you talk and have a say in things but so do others.

- Be responsible: own your actions and stop using other people for your deeds.

- Don't be evil: it is a tiring trope, we have seen it already. You can stop, ok?
