![CRAZY WORK](https://dcgc.io/crazy-work.png)

“It’s crazy at work.” How often do we hear this? Probably too often. For me, “it’s crazy at work” was my normal. Why is that? At the root is an onslaught of physical and virtual real-time distractions slicing work days into a series of fleeting work moments. Tie that together with a trend of unneeded over-collaboration, plus an unhealthy obsession with growth at any cost, and you’ve got the building blocks for an anxious, crazy mess. It’s no wonder people are working longer and whenever they have a spare moment. People can’t get work done at work anymore. Work takes away from life and life has become work’s leftovers. Long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days. Companies that force their personnel into this deal are molding an ineffective shape at their employees’ expense. You would think with all the hours people are putting in, and all the promises of the latest tech and the best benefits, the load would be diminishing or lighter. It is not, in fact, it is getting heavier. Many modern companies seem to be great at one thing: wasting. Wasting time, attention, money, energy. Out of the 60, 70, 80 hours a week many are expected to pour into work, how many of those hours are really spent on the work itself? And how many are tossed away in meetings, lost to distraction, and withered away by inefficient business practices? The majority. The answer isn’t more hours, it’s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. Promises keep coming and more time management hacks are done. More ways to communicate. More information spread across separate platforms and disparate places. New demands to pay attention to more and more real-time conversations happening all the time at work. It is meaningless.

It’s constantly crazy at work. Screw that and enough already. It’s time to stop celebrating this way of working. Chaos should not be the natural state at work. Anxiety isn’t a prerequisite for progress. Sitting in meetings all day isn’t required for success. These are all perversions of work — side effects of broken models and worst practices. Step aside, let the suckers jump, and follow a different path of your own.
