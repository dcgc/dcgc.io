![CRAZY WORK](https://dcgc.io/crazy-work.png)

“It’s crazy at work.” How often do we hear this? Probably too often. For me, “it’s crazy at work” was my normal. Why is that? At the root is an onslaught of physical and virtual real-time distractions slicing work days into a series of fleeting work moments. Tie that together with a trend of unneeded over-collaboration, plus an unhealthy obsession with growth at any cost, and you’ve got the building blocks for an anxious, crazy mess. It’s no wonder people are working longer and whenever they have a spare moment. People can’t get work done at work anymore. Work takes away from life and life has become work’s leftovers. Long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days, and sometimes, we are contributing to it to a fault (me included). Companies that force their personnel into this deal are molding an ineffective shape at their employees’ expense. You would think with all the hours people are putting in, and all the promises of the latest tech and the best benefits, the load would be diminishing or gwtting lighter. It is not, in fact, it is getting heavier. Many modern companies seem to be great at one thing: wasting. Wasting time, attention, money, energy. Out of the 60, 70, 80 hours a week many are expected to pour into work, how many of those hours are really spent on the work itself? And how many are tossed away in meetings, lost to distraction, and withered away by inefficient business practices? The majority. The answer isn’t more hours, it’s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. Promises keep coming and more time management hacks are done. More ways to communicate. More information spread across separate platforms and disparate places. New demands to pay attention to more and more real-time conversations happening all the time at work. It is meaningless.

It’s constantly crazy at work. Screw that and enough already. It’s time to stop celebrating this way of working. Chaos should not be the natural state at work. Anxiety isn’t a prerequisite for progress. Sitting in meetings all day isn’t required for success. These are all perversions of work — side effects of broken models and worst practices. Step aside, let the suckers jump, and follow a different path of your own. What does matter is your strength to improve the quality of your life, and not to sacrifice everything for the sake of nothing. Let's highlight some of the things we can avoid and some of the things we can follow, and base it on examples of my own experience.

## Company as a Software

When we start working in some places, one of the first things we learn is the company's culture. Usually it surrounds on things like hierarchy structure, how departments are molded, and the flow of actions to be taken. In some organizations, that are usually non-tech and where their main business is not technology, we tend to see that; in other organizations, that are focused on development of software (software-house) or are focused on a product that is technological (software product), we see less of that to some degree. The problem is that companies that are adverse to change will not change their ways when needed, or if they will, it will be due to the outcome of an office politics arm-wrestling between people in management positions (usually middle management, trying to show that they are necessary), so it will be done focusing on the ego of these people and not on the improvement of the company. If we think of a company as a software product, we can think of it in terms of usability and usefulness, as well as focusing on its betterment through tweaking, revising, and iterating. Every software has bugs and bad design, and so does a company. All sorts of new possibilities for improvement emerge and when we realize the way we work is malleable, we can start molding something new, something better.
