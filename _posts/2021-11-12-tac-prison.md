Modern slavery is the exploitation of other people for personal or commercial gain. Usually, it is hidden in plain sight and some form of slavery is more accepted by society than others. People become enclosed in these accepted ecosystems, packing goods, serving food, cleaning floors, making clothes, reaping crops, operating factory machinery and supporting IT products. Corporate entities have an enormous place in this *état d’habitude* and it has been among us for so long that people consider this a normality.

Life is so busy that we don’t have time to stop and think about all around us: why things are the way they are, why we do the things we do, how we spend our life. I had such an occasion in the past, with tasks up to my head, with eyes set on me every corner I turned, with unreasonable expectations from people above me and favor exchanges from several *cliques*. Considering my term (employee for life), I felt I had no way out. I was able to escape and, finally, I have had the time to stop and to reflect about it, but not reminisce. I am free for about two years; I was another prisoner from a TAC (Technical Assistance Center). This is an explanation of what to face when going to such a place.

## Welcome to TAC: Step by step

**Recruiting (Step 1):** Join unknowingly a specific weird team, roughly broken into different products or disciplines, with localized flair. Of course, these are a lie, and you are being thrown into a collection of queues. All the vendor industry companies have the same strategy when it comes to product support.

The grass looks greener on the other side and the Vendor makes sure about it. When applying to a TAC team, you are given a brief and, often, confusing explanation on what exactly a TAC engineer does. “Customer Support” can be done in different ways and can mean just about anything, “Trusted Technical Authority” can come from different departments and at different stages of the acquisition and signing of a product/service by the customer, “Collaborate with top talent” does not specify the type of collaboration you will embark in and “You are not alone” couldn’t be farther from the truth. So, when you are a beginner (as often hired TAC engineers are) and you are faced with such a job proposition you will get confused about a lot of what is in the description, and even if you research about it, you will simply not get the full picture of what the job is because... you simply don’t have the experience in the IT industry and you do not understand how some of the marketplace and product space works. You can’t ask questions because either you need the job badly or you want to join this reputable company no matter the cost. Only after being inside, having a few years under your belt, or someone explaining beat by beat, will you understand the structure of Vendor companies.

Either way, when you get recruited, depending on the process, you will either join a team you applied for, join a completely different team inside the domain you work for, or join a completely different team in another domain. This is due to the head count and workload that different products generate for the Vendor company (normally having to do with how faulty and crappy the product is), and the tactics usually set in place by the recruitment or hiring management revolve around arguments based on figures from studies in the IT industry or myths that never get unraveled. For example, Cybersecurity has a shortage of people, and we need cannon fodder for our Security team to deal with tickets that have nothing to do with Security. In terms of company culture, some of the more general tactics for persuading new people into joining have to do with benefits (parties for everyone), inclusion (show your prison ink) and other boons that are presented with a pristine and crystal coat: these align with the company’s ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) policies. Training is another bullet point for “selling” the job, usually meaning bootcamps (bootcamps are ruining the credibility of engineer’s credentials and discrediting several reputable acronyms/badges) and online self-training (that you can get yourself).

**Onboarding (Step 2):** Training, TAC is the best at what they do, at least according to vendor company, vendor fanboys, security stans and beginners. You will get the best training according to presentation from HR and Onboarding. Get one to three weeks of fucking dreadful PowerPoint presentations with company template, and you will even end-up more confused due to tackling subjects that you shouldn’t to begin with, surrounded by new members with different level of knowledge. Did I mention that most of the new workers come from university?

Broken onboarding process is no shock for someone who has been around for a few years in this wheelhouse. But it is usually one of the most surprising aspects when you start working for the first time and are when you faced by it (your university teacher has been teaching for too long and has lost the sense of reality). TAC onboarding is no exception to the rule: you get employee engagement and introduction to the Vendor company that you already read when you applied for the position months/weeks before, you waste time with safety training, harassment training and other trainings about several topics (due to ESG and local/national law) that you already possess if you have common sense and you “enwrap” yourself into technical trainings (generic or specific) because either you “came off the street empty-handed” and you are “cheap”, or you are not in line with the norm and need to be molded.

The process can take few days or weeks, depending on the level of knowledge you are in (meaning, your corporate level inside the Vendor company). Usually while you’re at it, you start wondering what the point of it is and why wasting so much time in these activities. The reasons for such onboarding have to do with teams being warned beforehand that new people are coming in and preparing themselves (usually the manager and/or team lead) for extra headaches, and, meanwhile, newcomers are being indoctrinated, formatted for the role and the company is drawing attention away from work-related questions.

The Vendor will make you an expert in a very narrow technology domain, one of their products. This expertise is useless in any other Vendor company, even on similar positions, but on other hand, it is a way of marketing yourself once you want to get into the big and well-known companies outside of the Vendor space, that are “shop” using that Vendor. Nevertheless, the onboarding is an interregnum needed for the department and team to prepare themselves for the newcomer (it’s not about you, it’s about them).

**Laboring (Step 3):** Start working and devoting yourself to the cause.  You are new, you are dynamic, and you are young, and you have the capability to get up to pace with everything. But you will be shown the ropes by someone senior, right? Nope. You start doing what is called “ticket picking” (handling selected “easy” tickets) and then what is called “bomb throwing” (handling “shit show” tickets that no one wants). You are put into a situation in a ticket with a very high severity (why?), you must deal with customers you never heard of, with technology you never dealt with before, and when you think you will have the place to try to replicate and emulate the issue (laboratory), you don’t have access to it, or you don’t have the necessary gear. In the end, you get told by your manager to shut the fuck up, get out or go to the Learning Platform to learn about it (the videos don’t prepare you for anything in TAC). You will have the pleasure of meeting one of the most notoriously useless management styles in corporate environment.

I was cultivated and sprinkled by engineers, not because of what they taught me but because of what they showed me inadvertently. Ticket handling is done in very different ways by TAC engineers: sometimes to escape the madness, sometimes to show to your manager that you “exist”, sometimes because is just another day in the office, sometimes to prove something to someone inside/outside the team, sometimes to learn and improve, sometimes because you have no choice, etc. Power of observation is key to survive in this kind of environment (metrics) and expect no one to lend a hand without something in return. It is not a dream job (nothing is) but it can be less painful if you are low-key. You might be able to talk to super-smart people and learn a few things, but those are far and in-between the clutter you will find (sometimes is the people you least expect).

**Reporting (Step 4):** Report anomalies to developers regarding product, because you are only paid to follow Wiki articles and previous tickets to know how to solve issues. You don’t get the pleasure of working through bugs in several platforms, you are not even in the same organization/department as the developers, with no negotiation power in order to get a bug fixed.

The TAC Engineer position is a factory worker position: you learn a trade; you practice it over and over and there is no deviation from it. You didn’t invent the product, you don’t improve the product, and you don’t fix inherent issues with the product. You simply apply “bandages” and follow “handbooks” to understand what to do in different occasions. Any knowledge you would have that could even be helpful for different situations in tickets you would handle (e.g., knowledge of other Vendor products, knowledge of Application) is not welcome, in fact, it is disincentivized because it goes against the “flow of things”.

It’s not that having a deep knowledge on something is worthless, having a very deep knowledge of a single Vendor can be useful and is not necessarily a bad thing (it doesn’t hurt to have, the more the merrier), but it can’t really be the ONLY thing. And this is what entails being a TAC Engineer: you practice only one thing. If you want to tackle different things, you either move on (definitively of temporarily) to someplace else inside the Vendor, or you move to another company. Development of product is not reserved for this position, this is called BU (Business Unit), or also known as the developers.

One more thing to add regarding “TAC knowledge”, is that most people in the Enterprise world (customers) only skim the surface of knowledge for a large array of products from the Vendor, not because they are the common denominator, but because a lot of times they have scoured the Internet for an answer and to the best of their abilities they are unable to find an answer to the problem they are dealing with. The answer to this problem, this “knowledge”, mostly for troubleshooting and to understand how the product works “under-the-hood”, is “gated” with TAC and not documented at all. When you face TAC with questions regarding both these things, you are either ignored or simply not given the answer (it is the “secret sauce”).

**Laureling (Step 5):** Research and find “process gaps” in the team or department you are in and start developing useless tools and processes to only complicate even more, what is already complicated. Get rewarded or ignored for it, depending on who you align with.

With the rise of buzzwords regarding work methodologies, work organization, etc. you see a lot of implementations of processes (most often coming from Software Development) that are not applicable or not adjusted to other types of roles, domains and work types. Unfortunately, management and business folks oversee organizations, and most often than not, are presented with new concepts or with “what is hip” in the industry. Because most of them don’t have critical and thoughtful thinking, not really doing their research into understanding if what they learned is applicable to their setting, they are ready to “jump the gun” and apply these to their environment.

Because these processes and these concepts are tied with metrics and company culture, this means that whoever in the team comes up with new ways of “easing” things for everyone, will more than likely get treated pleasantly and might have good fortunes awaiting (e.g., promotion, bonus, etc.). The problem is that this creates another coat of competition between team members, forces engineers to dedicate part of their time into “solving” problems that should be solved differently and discourages actual rational and innovative thinking into revising processes that are outdated. The most common example is automation and agile just for the sake of it.

**Fleeing (Step 6):** Get sick or go on a leave, so you can escape this hell for a few days or weeks.

Finally, you will get fucking exhausted and want to quit everything altogether or you will feel burned out and having to take a few days off. Workplace burnout is a real thing and TAC foments this. This has to do with the workload generated from the number of customers the Vendor signs with and provides support (as per contract signed) and with their appetite for more dollar bills, even if their technical support infrastructure cannot handle more. Besides the work itself, you have the people: some TAC engineers in some teams are the cornerstone of the department and are part of the DNA, having a voice in several matters. Those TAC engineers can be a pain in the ass and uncooperative, usually thinking that they are the best in the world in their respective domain. They definitely aren't, sometimes even embarrassing themselves in the showboating, but because of this, they do love grilling and ridiculing others. If you don’t have toughness to handle them, you will get tired quickly.

The truth of the matter is that you are just another person passing by, if you go, they will get someone else. It is even truer for this role. The amount of people who get burned out or disappointed by TAC is so big that the rotation of personnel is high. Depending on the company and depending on your type of employment, you might have several ways out to “reset” your brain away from TAC and return to the “grind” after all is good. Refer to your contract and/or national/local labor law.

## The cliques

As in a prison, TAC quality depends a lot on the product, people and pervasive engineering culture: prepare yourself. The effect of working in TAC was rewarding and encouraging growth, progress and hard work. Nowadays, you are not seen as the future of the company or as a potential employee, but as another worker (unless you align yourself appropriately). You are not encouraged to be better today than you were yesterday, and this is what changed in TAC. What the Vendor is looking for is not your approach to resolving an issue and expertise, but to resolve the issue and follow a recipe.

### Disciplines

**Networking:** Most of the people who work on this domain usually come from the Electrical Engineering field, not having knowledge in general about IT (be it processes, standards or even other domains that operate over the network) and only having knowledge about outdated network protocols, enterprise routing and switching protocols, physical network cabling, fiber, coaxial and landline. They don't know much about Software, Operating Systems and Security.

**Systems:** Most of the people who work on this domain usually come from the Computer Engineering field and were not good programmers while studying or when they startedw working, or decided to follow an Administration role (normally, between Windows and Linux). They have good understanding of Networking and Operating Systems, some of them are even good at scripting and automating several administration roles and are good at using Vendor applications or tools for Administration purposes (e.g., backups, monitoring, etc.).

**Application:** Most of the people who work on this domain usually come from the Computer Engineering field or from a reconversion program. They studied to become developers and to work in different parts of an Application (e.g., backend, frontend, etc.) or with different Applications altogether (e.g., WebApp, MobileApp, Web Services, etc.). The do not understand much of networking, but in more recent years, developers have begun acquiring an understanding of Operating Systems and Servers (because of underlying architecture serving the applications they develop).

### The People

**Helpers:** the people who you want to work with and interact, they are the people who will help you in need of assistance. Save some of the questions (after researching and doing your part) and ask to them. They will gladly give you a "push" and direct you towards the solution. They usually are team players and care about the team and newcomers. Unfortunately, they are a minority.

**Blockers:** the people who you want to avoid talking on a regular basis but that you want to keep a superficial connection and keep "appearences". These people hate what they do at work and some of them are good at what they do. Because the job sucks and because of lack of perspectives in their career (or lack of opportunities) they have to content with what they have. Because of the grudge and spite they have over the company, but more often than not, because of the envy and hate they have towards other colleagues, they will block others. This can take the form of interpersonal relationship blockage (e.g., gossips) or can take the form of professional blockage (e.g, sabotage). Fortunately, they are a minority.

**Don't Carer:** the people who you can rely on most of the time, because they don't care about consequences. Usually they are exceptional at their job, help others if asked, and do their job rather quick because they don't care about the job. It is just something they do for money and if whatever they need to do to maintain is enough, they will do it. On the other hand, because they are very good, they can change job if they please. Because they don't care.

**Smokers/Kitcheners:** the people who got a need to go smoke outside or go to the kitchen every 30 minutes, because either that is how they operate (hyperactive) to stay focused and motivated for the job, or because they need to "catch a breath". With COVID-19 and Home Office, these people will stop existing.

**Assholer:** the people who are assholes and need to show it to everyone. They smudge it in their colleague's faces. Usually is because they have personal problems, are unsatisfied with their lives, or have envy of other colleagues, but cannnot be better than others.

**Go-To-er:** the people who are always requested by their manager and are always asked questions by their colleagues because they are good enough at what they do, but are gullible to help others (and sometimes work for others) all the time.

**Complainer:** the people who are always complaining, rightfully so or just for the sake of it (doesn't necessary have to be about work). They get energy from it and can inspire others to do the same if the team is in a rough spot. Usually these people pay the price for it, unless they have a favourable spot in the team.

**Ghoster:** the people who are always working in the shadows, delivering results (or not), not knowing where they are and at what time they arrive and leave the office.
