I am still at the dog pound and I am still waiting for someone to pick me up. This place is a hell hole and I am tired of sharing a cell with bulldog and sausage dog over here. I hope someone will pick me up for real, not like the empty promises I get everyday from these weird women that love animals too much. They said I am about to meet my new owner tomorrow, we shall see...

I am finally getting out of this joint and going somewhere else. I hope my new owner is not a fucking weirdo and that I am going to a normal place. I was super happy to see my new owner is a regular dude and not some psycho, everything was ready at the place I arrived, and I was not expecting this at all to be honest. The only problem is that I didn't know where the dog's restroom was, so I figured i just piss and shit on the floor. And guess what, the guy just started cleaning my stuff and smiling at me. What a dork.

After my first night of sleep everything still felt weird. I was no longer in the cell and was free to roam around an apartment. He got me some toys (I don't understand what is his obsession with the blue color), and got me some nice food. I no longer have to eat that crap from the shelter. Besides that, the day was pretty chill, he kept staring at three illuminated squares all day and talking to wall. What a weirdo.

The guy left the house today and didn't say anything. I mean, the least you can do is warn someone and let them know where you headed. For just a couple of hours, but still... After that, he finally took me outside but still inside the apartment complex. I didn't see anyone, this place looks like a ghost town.

Today I started getting hiccups, this guy turns the heating all the way up at the flat, and when I come from outside I feel the difference in temperature. Either that, or a piece of meat he gave me. I mean, he must be from someplace warm or from another planet, if he can't handle this cold or if he doesn't know what to feed me... Anyway, the grains he got me and that I am eating regularly now are amazing and to die for. I am always waiting for my food and like to challenge him with my beautiful puppy eyes for an extra dose. When I was home, I got new toys. One was a weird wood that humans put in their mouths, it is called a "cigar" and the other was a small man who has orange hair (I think he was the president at some point). anyway, my owner has a weird taste in toys... just give me a plank of wood, a rope and a ball, really...

Now it has become a routine for my owner to walk around the block, given I finally went to the doggy doctor and I was given permission. She was very nice looking and my owner stopped paying attention to me all of a sudden. Weird... She checked my butt (huh huh) and she gave me a pill to swallow so I don't have any parasites, os something like that. Even my owner didn't know what she was talking about... The least favourite part was when she stuck a needle up my... yes. Until next time, I guess...

Now it is the weekend and I have to stay at home and only go around the neighbourhood with my owner for the whole two days. I saw a couple of people asking how old I was and what was my name to my owner, instead of asking it to me... I mean, it is just lack of courtesy, really. The doctor told my owner I could vomit because of the pill, and shortly after I ate some nice wallnut wholemeal grains, I barfed and vomit a little. My owner was once again cleaning my mess and very happy doing it. I was smelly, with the vomit and the dirt outside, so the owner gave me a nice bath in his bathtub. I hope he won't get parasites.

I was playing outside with my owner and got a little too excited... meaning, I tore his pants up with my teeth and paws. He was not happy and he had to change pants. He kept mumbling and talking to himself for hours, what does he want, just change the damn pants and move on. It's a Dockers, not Yves Laurent. When I was outside I also saw a funny looking dog trying to challenge me... like I am scared of any dog, I am not scared of anyone and if that dog ever shows up again I am gonna stuff my face to him.

When I was playing with my ball, I saw my arch-nemesis once again. I challenge him but both my owner and his owner separated us. Next time, he will not survive my claws... Argh!
