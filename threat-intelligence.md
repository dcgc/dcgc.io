CTI Analyst:
- Analyze successful/unsuccessful intrusions by targeted threat actors
- Construct descriptions of campaigns, actors, and organizations
- Seek, collect and exploit intelligence from others
- Generate intel from their own data sources and share it accordingly
- Manage intel to firther the objectives of their organizations

APT is a style, not a definitive category, and needs to be taken into consideration.
- APT is any persistent focused adversary with sufficient resources, not necessarily advanced methods.
- Malware and other ill-intended methods are just a tool; the threat is the human behind the attack.
- Results impact can be costly due to the scope target operated by the APT.
- Increases in threat intelligence on top of already well-functioning security programs can reduce the effectiveness of the threat.
- We should not think of Threat Intelligence as the silver bullet (evidence and data to stop the attacks) but as complementary security procedure, part of security operations center.


Intelligence collects and processes information about competitive entity and agents (maligned actors), needed by an organization for its security (defense) and well-being (operational).
- Intelligence Sources:
	- HUMINT: Interpersonal (human)
	- GEOINT: Geospatial (satellite)
	- MASINT: Measurement/Signature (radar).
	- OSINT: Open-source collection (Internet, public records).
	- SIGINT: Signal Intercepts (cellphone, taps).
	- ALL SOURCE: Every available source (all above).
- Threat Intelligence falls in ALL SOURCE as we identify several sources and fuse it together.


Counterintelligence is:
-	Identification/Assessment/Neutralization/Exploitation of intelligence activities of adversarial entities.
-	CTI is Counterintelligence
