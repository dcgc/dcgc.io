CTI Analyst:
- Analyze successful/unsuccessful intrusions by targeted threat actors
- Construct descriptions of campaigns, actors, and organizations
- Seek, collect and exploit intelligence from others
- Generate intel from their own data sources and share it accordingly
- Manage intel to firther the objectives of their organizations

APT is a style, not a definitive category, and needs to be taken into consideration.
- APT is any persistent focused adversary with sufficient resources, not necessarily advanced methods.
- Malware and other ill-intended methods are just a tool; the threat is the human behind the attack.
- Results impact can be costly due to the scope target operated by the APT.
- Increases in threat intelligence on top of already well-functioning security programs can reduce the effectiveness of the threat.
- We should not think of Threat Intelligence as the silver bullet (evidence and data to stop the attacks) but as complementary security procedure, part of security operations center.


**Intelligence collects and processes information about competitive entity and agents (maligned actors), needed by an organization for its security (defense) and well-being (operational).**

Intelligence Sources:
	- HUMINT: Interpersonal (human)
	- GEOINT: Geospatial (satellite)
	- MASINT: Measurement/Signature (radar).
	- OSINT: Open-source collection (Internet, public records).
	- SIGINT: Signal Intercepts (cellphone, taps).
	- ALL SOURCE: Every available source (all above).
- Threat Intelligence falls in ALL SOURCE as we identify several sources and fuse it together.


**Counterintelligence is:**
-	Identification/Assessment/Neutralization/Exploitation of intelligence activities of adversarial entities.
-	CTI is Counterintelligence

**Definitions:**
-	Analysis is to deconstruct intrusions and threat actors.
-	Synthesis is to construct objects based on unsuccessful intrusions (enhancing understanding of the intrusion), adversary profile and campaigns.
-	Analytical Judgement uses a process to search for, sort, structure and evaluate data and information. There is never enough time or data; decisions still need to be made.
-	Good CTI thinks about how they think and reaching a conclusion is defensible, repeatable and understandable to others. CTI’s have different views (people are different). Perception should be active.
-	Bias is a hindrance to analysis and impossible to eliminate, difficult to understand. Guarantee diversity of CTI analysts (knowledge type) and collaboration between each other to favor less bias. Different backgrounds can also help (e.g., APT is Russian and CTI Analyst understands Russian).
-	Adversary intent is one of the most difficult goals in intelligence analysis.

**Types of Analysis: **
-	**Data-driven: accuracy based on dataset’s accuracy and completeness.**
	-	Should be Logically driven.
	-	Use Good datasets.
-	**Conceptually-driven: accuracy based by feedback over time.**
	-	Immediate interpretation of complex concepts.
	-	Numerous unknowns and undefined variables and relationships.
-	**Structured Techniques: approaches in better evaluating information while reducing impact of bias.**
	-	Data into buckets allows for the abstraction of the CTI analyst and identification of patterns.
	-	E.g., Analysis of competing hypotheses, devil’s advocate, Team A/B, High-Impact/Low-Probability, Brainstorming, Red Team
-	**Mental Models: experience based on assumptions and expectations.**
	-	Combination of cognitive and perceptual biases that can hinder analysis.
-	**Mosaic Theory: inappropriate belief that there is only one mosaic to make.**
	-	Disparate information comes together to tell the right story.
	-	Rarely practical and heavily based on analyst interpretation.
-	**Other: descriptive (describes elements of data), explanatory (structure “why” of the situation), evaluative (understand what information means), estimative (“what will happen next?”).**
